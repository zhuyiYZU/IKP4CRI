0,Do you know what kind of movie trailer you are interested in watching?

0,OK!
0,There are a lot of great comedy trailers out right now.
0,"Do you have any particular actors/actresses you want to see, or do you want to be surprised?"

0,Sounds like you appreciate movies that are witty as well as goofy.
0,"Yes, I think that's a good assessment of my taste!"

0,Alright.
0,Let me pull up some recommendations for you.

0,Thank you so much for your help!
0,OK - my first recommendation is Being John Malkovich.
0,"It's set in current day, and definitely incorporates a surreal element."
0,The premise is that John Cusack finds a portal that leads him into the mind of movie star John Malkovich - who plays a dramatized version of himself.
0,He does a great job and seems to have a lot of fun with the role.
0,It was nominated for three Oscars.
0,"That sounds really interesting, I like the surreal elements."

1,A little less rom-com.
0,Maybe something a bit more like the movie QUOTATION_MARKTagQUOTATION_MARK in which it's mostly comedy with a bit of action peppered in?
0,"Alright, wil you like to see 'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World'"
0,What is that about?
0,this is best movie when you are in desperate need of a good belly laugh.

0,I think that'll be the movie I go see then!
0,Thank you!!

0,"Though, I do have a couple more questions about the movie, if you don't mind."

0,You know what they stands for.
0,"Those are the actors, yes."
0,Is the movie any good?
0,"Yes, a mix of adventure, comedy and fantasy"
0,Is there any movies I should watch before I watch this movie?
0,"Not really, you watch this right away"
0,So this is a standalone.

1,The dumber the better.
0,Have you seen any of the Austin Powers movies?
0,"I've seen the first two, and part of the third, which I thought sucked, sadly."
0,The first one is a classic.

0,"I've never heard of it, but it sounds intriguing."
0,Tell me more :)
0,It's got the guy from Mr. Bean in it.
0,Basically he's a mess of an agent because the directors of the agency never really intended for him to become an agent.
0,I love Rowan Atkinson!
0,I love Mr. Bean!
0,I am definitely interested in this now.
0,I love his chaotic but innocent energy.
0,Good!

0,Netflix movies are perfectly acceptable!
0,There's a new Disney one called Noelle that looks funny!
0,Oh I don't know if I heard of that one?
0,What is it about?
0,I watched Klaus the other day and it was actually really good like I can see it becoming a Christmas classic.
0,"It's about Kris Kringle's Daughter, where she wants to find her role, since her brother is Nick, who takes over for Santa eventually."
0,"Or is supposed to, if he was good at it!"
0,So I think it will have a lot of silly moments.
0,Oh that definetely seems like something I would enjoy!
0,Thanks for the recommendation - I accept it!
0,"Sounds kinda similar to what I watched last night, which was about Santa's daughter and how she wanted to go to college and not take over the family business."
0,That sounds funny too!
0,I hope you enjoy it!
0,Getting into the Christmas spirit!
0,Yes I am!
0,"I have another suggestion from, an older one that is just as silly as the newer one, called Bad Santa, have you seen that one?"
0,I have not seen that one
0,"It's a decent one, wacky adventures, a guy pretending to be santa and all the things that go with that."
0,"It's not as wholesome, but sometimes that's what makes it fun."
0,"hmmm I will consider it, could be funny but I think I do prefer wholesome."
0,"Hm, alright, what about Christmas Angel"
0,Hmm I think I saw the trailer to that and it seemed too cheesy or bad acting
0,"Oh here's one, the Night Before, it's got Seth Rogen in it, so it should be pretty funny."
0,"It's about the night before christmas, looking for a christmas party."
0,oh seth rogen is funny!

0,I think suspenseful is better
0,"It from 2017 is the highest grossing horror movie of all time, would you be interested in it, or have you seen It before?"

0,I don't think I've seen either of those although I feel like I should have.
0,I know Lock Stock is referenced  in some of the shows i have watched.
0,They are both similar in tone and style.

0,I like the fast pace of the film.
1,I like watching someone do something on screen that I can't.
0,Same here!
0,"Joker is a really great origin story, but if you like an action-packed comedy, I'd really recommend Zombieland 2."
0,I've heard really good things about Joker.
0,It may be a bit too dark for me.
0,What is the plot about?
0,"It pretty much shows how the Joker fit into society when he was trying to function as a normal human being, and it gives insight on his mental illness and background as a clown-like character."
0,"It is kind of dark, which definitely makes sense to his character."
0,"Hm, sounds very interesting."
0,I do like comic book movies as well.
0,What is the plot of Zombieland 2?
0,"Zombieland 2 is a sequel to Zombieland, where strangers are brought together as a survival team in the zombie apocalypse."

0,That sounds like a good movie.

0,Zombieland is his best known movie!
0,Did you see the 1st film?
0,Do you think I would have to see the 1st film to understand the 2nd?
0,"I did see the first film, but everything is explained pretty well in the second one so you wouldn't need to see the first film to understand."
0,That sounds good.
0,I'll accept your recommendation of Zombieland 2.
0,Great!
0,I think you'll enjoy it.
0,I'm sure I will thanks to you.
0,Hello!
0,I am here to help you find a movie to watch.
0,I am looking for an action type movie
0,Do you like superhero movies?
0,"I do, but I was thinking something more spy thiller"
0,"James Bond movies are a great option for that, and there are a ton of those movies to choose from."
0,"I like Bond, maybe one of the older one's."
0,What is your favorite one?
0,"My personal favorite is Casino Royale, one of the more contemporary ones."
0,"However, Goldfinger is close second and came out in the 60's, so pretty old!"
0,"I like that one, where he robs the Federal Reserve."
0,"Sweet, good choice, that is what I will go with, Goldfinger"
0,I'm glad to hear that!
0,I hope you enjoy it.
0,"Thanks, I think it will be a great movie night."
0,"It appears I can't find the film anywhere online, I think Casino Royale would be a great second choice if that works for you."
0,"In my opinion, Daniel Craig is an even better Bond than Sean Connery."
0,"I think that will work, as that particular one does a good job channeling the older Bond films."
0,"Thanks for the effort, and recommendation."
0,"Of course, it was my pleasure."
0,Have you seen the Bond where he gets married?
0,"It is the one with the one-off Bond actor, in-between Connery and Moore"
0,"I dont think I have, what year did it come out?"
0,"69, On Her Majesty's Secret Service."
0,He is seen as the Bond closest to the character based in Fleming's Books about Bond
0,"Thats interesting, considering it seems very out of his playboy character to get married."
0,"Definitely, it is a different Bond, in tone."
0,"If you like Bond, and want a goofy version check out, In Like Flint, reminds me of an early Austin Powers"
0,"That's a great recommendation, thank you!"
0,"I was a big fan of Austin Powers as a kid, but I think I saw it a little too young as a lot of the jokes went over my head."
0,"Cool, seems like we both have a good movie to go watch."
0,Hi!
0,I'm here to help you find a trailer!
0,"Sounds great, what do you recommend?"
0,Hmm depends.

0,What was the last one you watched?
1,"I just watched Shutter Island, big fan"
0,That was a good movie!
0,You must like the edge of your-seat-kind of suspense.
0,I'd totally recommend the movie Split!
0,What is that about?
0,It's a man that has around 25 different personalities that are trying to make the world QUOTATION_MARKpureQUOTATION_MARK.
0,Watching the actor shift between characters really plays with your mind.
0,"Wow, that sounds interesting."
0,Who's the main actor?
0,Must have been hard to play 25 different people
0,"He's James McAvoy, he's also the younger Professor X from the X-Men movies."
0,He dd an amazing job jumping between characters.
0,He's the only actor ever to play so many in one film.
0,I loved the X-Men movies.
1,Do you have any recommendation on superhero movies as well?
0,Hands down would be Deadpool and Deadpool 2 especially if you love the X-Men!
0,"I saw the first one, is Deadpool 2 about a similar plot?"
0,Only a little.
0,It pushes more as a continuation from the first one.
0,Deadpool actually gets a team together and learns the meaning of family.
0,What do you think about the new Joker?
0,"To be honest, I haven't seen it yet but it's on my top list!"
0,I know it doesn't follow the DC line but it puts a human face to Joker which is something that has never been done.
0,I love that kind of in depth cinema.
0,I can't wait to see it.
0,I just recently saw it and definitely think it's bound to get an Oscar nomination!
0,What did you think off Avengers Endgame?
0,That movie was insane!
0,Utterly graphically insane!
0,I loved it!!
0,The did such a well rounded end it was such a surprise.
0,Agreed!

0,Now I won't be able to unthink it.
0,Argh.

0,"I don't disagree, just curious to learn your thoughts on the matter"
0,Just hard to catch lightning in a bottle like that.

0,"Definitely far from a conventional horror narrative and it is willing to push boundaries, so that gives off the indie QUOTATION_MARKvibeQUOTATION_MARK, etc."
0,Think you might like it!
0,Yes I did see it!
0,I thought Lupita Nyongo's performance was amazing.
0,And definitely agree about the family dynamics part.
0,Got it.
0,Nice!
0,"The next suggestion isn't quite coming-of-age, but definitely small-budget and terrifying in a QUOTATION_MARKpsychological thrillerQUOTATION_MARK kind of way..."
0,Ever seen Pi by Darren Aronofsky?
0,No I haven't!
0,"But I love psychological thrillers, what's that one about?"
0,Seen ANY Aronofsky films?
0,They all have some thematic similarities.
0,"Pi is about a guy's obsession with number theory, to summarize it VERY briefly."
0,yes!
0,I've seen Black Swan and Mother!
0,Both were absolutely excellent and so unsettling
0,I definitely suggest Pi then.
0,"It's a little more claustrophobic than Black Swan, but in a way that suits the obsession theme well."
0,it sounds so good.
0,I definitely am interested in that and accept that recommendation
0,Sounds great!
0,Enjoy!
0,I wrote a scholarly article on Aronofsky and am definitely a fan.
0,I hope you are too!
0,Check out all of his stuff once you get time to.
0,I absolutely will.
0,Thanks again for this recommendation!
0,You know your stuff!
0,"With movies, at least."
0,Terribly QUOTATION_MARKunderinformedQUOTATION_MARK about other sides of life.
0,"Anyhow, hope you enjoy."
0,Haha I am the same way.
0,Everyone has specialties.
0,Just don't obsess over any of them to the point where you become like Pi's main character!
0,I think I can safely say that without spoiling it.
0,Happy viewing.
0,thanks again!
0,Hi
0,Hey!

0,Love Will Smith!
0,I will have to look for that trailer.
0,Do you know when it was released?
0,Recently?
0,It was relaesed recently
0,"Oh, is that the one where the used CGI to create a younger Will Smith?"

0,Thanks for a great recommendation.
0,I will be watching.
1,Any other suggestions?
0,Did you watch The Equalizer?
0,Is that the movie with Denzel Washington?
0,I think I saw that one.
0,Yes!
0,did you liked it
0,I did!
0,He is a great actor.
0,Do you know of any other movies he has done?
0,Fences is a good one
0,I haven't heard of that one.
0,I will take a look for the trailer.
0,Good suggestion.
0,Do you plan to see the Black Widow movie that comes out next year?
0,Part of the MCU?
0,I haven't seen the trailer yet so i don't know what it's about
0,I don't think there is a trailer but it supposed to be set between the first 2 avengers movies.
0,"A lot of people don't like the MCU, but I am a fan."
0,I just basically love movies and I am glad for your two recommendations.
0,You welcome!
0,Have a great Monday!
0,Hello!
0,Hi there!
0,Do you know what kind of movies do you like?
1,"I love indie, comedy, coming of age and thrillers."
1,I also love horror!
0,I am not a fan of action films or romance much.
0,What was the last horror movie you watched?
0,I saw Midsommar in theaters.
0,"I didn't think it was scary, more just upsetting, I really liked Hereditary which is from the same director."
0,"I've also been wanting to see It 2, I loved the original and the remake!"
0,I saw It 2 myself and it was fantastic!
0,I think the casting was perfect
0,oh my gosh YES!
0,"I am such a fan of Bill Hader too, I thought that was perfect."
0,Did you see Get Out or Us?
0,What did you think?
0,I thought get out was phenomenal and Us was really scary but had lots of plot holes.
0,"I think he could've built the world a little better but I thought Lupita's performance was absolutely terrifying, she really made the movie for me."
0,"Us was probably one of the most terrifying films I've seen in a long time, not because of the film itself, but because of the theory of a secret world."
0,and her voice?!
0,Holy crap.
0,That and her physical movements.
0,I thought that was such a standout performance.
0,Apparently she didn't tell anyone she was doing the voice like that until they started rolling and the other actors were absolutely terrified.
0,She is amazing!
0,"based on your taste in films, i would recommend QUOTATION_MARKA Quiet PlaceQUOTATION_MARK,"
0,Wonderful.
0,I absolutely adored A Quiet Place.
0,The fact that they used a deaf actress and sign language was fantastic.
0,"I am heavily involved in the deaf community and know ASL myself, so I was so beyond pleased with the film and authentic representation of the deaf community."
0,I accept!
0,"Amazing, thank you!"
0,Did you see Birdbox?
0,I thought it was pretty well done as well even though it was a similar concept.
0,I have but i was truly disappointed in the ending
0,totally.
0,I liked that they used blind people but it was a bit of a cop out ending.
0,I also wanted to know why the crazy people from the mental hospital weren't affected?
0,"It seems like they ran out of ideas and wanted to fill time, a common thread for Netflix films"
0,haha absolutely.
0,I watched tall girl because I knew it would be bad and boy was it.
0,So so cheesy.
0,What happened?
0,It's literally a film about a girl in high school whose tall.
0,That's the plot.
0,About how it's so hard being 5'11 and no guy is tall enough for her.
0,"It was so ridiculous, if you need a good laugh I recommend."
0,They took it so seriously too.
0,Like being tall was a plague.
0,hello!
0,Hello
0,whats up
0,killing some time before I go home from work.
0,How about you?
0,yeah its super rainy here.
0,I think a movie would be nice
0,what kinds of movies do you like?
0,I like scifi
1,"Nice, have you seen any good scifi movies lately?"
0,i saw starwars.
0,What is the last movie that you watched?
0,The last movie I watched was the last Star Wars movie on Disney plus
0,awesome.
0,so you like scifi too?
0,"Some, my son and I watch Star Wars together a lot."
0,I also like drama/action/history
0,oh i was thinking of recommending mission impossible rogue nation.
0,it's not too old but a great action movie
0,what do you like about it?
0,well.. it stars tom cruise which is a no brainer and the graphics and scale is very grandios
0,"I'm really not a huge fan of the mission impossible franchise, though."
1,What else do you recommend?
0,how about i am legend.
0,It's a pretty old movie but its a action/thriller
0,and it has some of the scifi element too
0,yeah and its will smith baby!
0,"that sounds good, I'll check that one out."
0,Thanks for your recommendation.
0,DO you like drama?
0,"I do enjoy a good drama, actually."
0,Have you seen The Joker?
0,"I've been under a rock, so I have not seen The Joker yet."
0,Do you think it would be of interest to me?
0,What types of movies do you normally watch?
1,"I often opt for movies that are realistic and grounded in their premises, and feature characters that don't cleanly fit into any stereotype"
0,Then I do think you would enjoy Joker
0,Does The Joker have a good deal of action in it?
0,"Yes it does, It has drama action suspense"
0,"You mentioned suspense, does it deliver the suspense well?"
0,Yes it is very intense
0,Then I absolutely want to watch The Joker.
0,Thank you for the recommendation.
0,You're welcome.
0,Tells a side of the Joker no one has known
0,That sounds wonderful.
0,I accept that recommendation.
0,Great.
0,I hope you enjoy.
0,...The 'Accept' button seems to be absent.
0,I think there needs to be 10 turn total
0,"I see, I thought we had met that minimum."
0,Would you say that The Joker requires a lot of knowledge about the existing DC Comics universe to understand it?
0,No it does not.
0,This is a whole new storline
0,"Wonderful, I haven't been keeping up with it so that would've been a little concerning."
0,Hello!
0,Would you like my help to recommend a movie?
0,Hi I am wondering if you have seen any good movies lately?
0,"I have, I just saw Frozen 2."
0,What about you?
0,"I have not see it yet, but I have heard some things about it."
0,Did you like it?
0,"I did, the animation was great."
0,"The story was just okay though, have you seen any movies recently?"
0,I was wondering if the songs were good in Frozen?
0,The last movie I saw was the Addams Family
0,"They were good, none of them were bad but I don't think any of them were that amazing."
0,"Oh, so you like animated movies?"
1,"I do go to a lot of animated movies, mostly because that is what my kids pick, but I do like them."
0,"Well, Frozen 2 is definitely entertaining for the whole family, I think!"
0,How old are your kids?
0,"I have a 10 year old and a 5 year old, so I think they will love Frozen."
0,I am sorry the songs were mediocre though!
0,"The songs weren't bad at all, I just don't think they can top Let it Go."
0,Y'know?
0,I think your kids are just the right age for Frozen 2 to come out though.
0,I agree and it would be difficult to top Let it Go!
0,Are there any new interesting characters?
0,Quite a few actually!
0,"Though the bad news is your kids might ask for toys of some of them, there was this really cool water horse I remember."
0,It was beautiful.
0,Oh no!
0,That is what I was afraid of!
0,I have not gotten a chance to look at the Frozen 2 toys yet.
0,"Well theres probably quite a few, they add a lot of cute new little characters."
0,"There was also a salamander that's pretty cute, I did like the new characters in the movie."
0,Well that is something to look forward to.
0,I will probably take them on Monday since they have off school.
0,I am sure I won't be the only one with that idea!
0,"Definitely not, plenty of kids in the theater for Frozen 2."
0,Just hope they're well-behaved!
0,"The kids in my theater were very quiet, aside from laughing at Olaf."
0,"Yes, Olaf is a favorite character of mine and the kids."
0,I was hoping he would be in Frozen 2!
0,Of course he is!
0,"Kids love him after-all, I thought he was funny for the most-part."
0,"Well, thanks so much for the recommendation!"
0,I thought about taking the kids and now you have convinced me to go for it because I am curious about the new characters.
0,Thanks again!
0,Hi
0,"hi, do you like movies?"
0,"I do, I am into comedy and action the most."
0,What about you?
0,"i really liked both Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody, but i also love comedies."
1,which ones have you seen recently and can recommend?
0,I recommend Long Shot with Seth Rogen.
0,His role is different that his other movies so it was interesting watching him.
0,It was a good movie that I would recommend.
0,I don't know anything about this movie.
1,Do you have any other suggestions?
0,Good Boys is another good comedy.
0,Same producers as Super bad.
0,I don't know anything about this movie either.
0,How about something more mainstream?
0,Something that sold a lot of tickets?
0,Toy Story 4 was a big hit and also very good.
0,It will bring out your inner kid.
0,That sounds like a great idea.
0,I love Tim Allen and Tom Hanks.
0,I will go see Toy Story 4 this weekend.
0,Thank you for this recommendation.
0,Sure thing.
0,I think you will enjoy it.
0,You also said you like action movies.

0,So you don't like Daniel Craig?
0,What about QUOTATION_MARKOn Her Majesties Secret Service?QUOTATION_MARK
0,That is my favorite movie.
0,But I also like QUOTATION_MARKGoldeneye.QUOTATION_MARK
0,No I do not think Daniel Craig was as good.
0,I have never seen that  QUOTATION_MARKOn Her Majesties Secret Service?QUOTATION_MARK
0,Any others?
0,Either Roger Moore or Sean Connery?
0,Definitely Rodger Moore.

0,I am looking for any action or scary movie to watch.
1,Any suggestions?
0,I'm a big fan of the Marvel Universe myself.
0,There are a few good ones out there.
0,Let's see if I can narrow it down a bit.
0,Are there any actors that you particularly enjoy?
0,And what style scary movie do you prefer?
0,More along the lines of horror/slasher or tense thriller or something else?
0,"I am a big fan too, so I've seen all of them!"
0,I might be leaning more towards a scary movie.
0,Last kind of scary movie I saw was Us.
0,So I am more interested in a tense thriller.
0,I don't like much the typical non sense slasher movie.
0,Perfect.
0,And are you looking for something that is in theaters now or a movie to watch at home?
1,I am looking for something to watch at home.
0,Okay.
0,I have a few things in mind.
0,One of my favorite thrillers is Copycat starring Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter.
0,Sigourney Weaver stars as an agoraphobic forensic psychologist who studies serial killers and Holly Hunter is a detective looking for a killer who is copying some of the most famous serial killers of all time murder
0,Oh es I have seen it is good.
0,I am looking for something more recent though.
0,"More on the line of Hereditary, It, Us, Dr. Sleep..."
0,Okay.
0,I understand.
0,Let me see what else I can find for you that's newer.
0,Great thanks!
0,"If you liked It, another good one based on Stephen King is Gerald's Game."
0,It's the same guy who directed Dr. Sleep.
0,"Oh yeah, I wanted to watch this one a while ago."
0,I totally forgot about it.
0,"Thank you so much, I accept your recommendation!!"

1,I am really bored right now so can you recommend me a movie to watch?
0,Are you a Disney or Super hero movie fan?
1,I am a Disney movie fan
0,The live action Lion King movie is better than what people gave it credit for
0,I am not really a fan of the live action Disney remake movies
0,Oh that's understandable.
0,Maybe you're a fan of pixar then?
0,"I do like Pixar but I've seen all their movies, I would like something a bit different"
0,Hmm any genre in particular?
1,I am looking for something that has romance
0,Romance huh?
0,Have you ever watched QUOTATION_MARKThe Silver liningQUOTATION_MARK?
0,I have never heard of that.
0,Is it a Disney movie?
0,No.
0,It's a romance movie.
0,"Oh, I was hoping for an animated Disney movie with romance in it"
0,Oh I don't mind providing suggestions about that.
0,I don't know which ones you already seen though.
0,"I have seen all Disney movies from 2010 and onward, so any before that with romance would be great"
0,"Hmm in that case, I feel like the Lady and the Tramp has a lot of romance."
0,I've heard of that but I think that has romance between dogs.
0,I was looking for something with romance between humans
0,What about someone that was human?
0,That sounds interesting!
0,Please let me know what movie it is
0,Beauty and the Beast
0,Sounds fun!
0,"Thanks for the recommendation, I accept it and I will watch it right now!"
0,Thank you.

1,"I enjoy romantic comedies, action, and children's movies."
0,"Pixar has a great selection of children's movies that also appeal to adults, are you familiar with Pixar?"
0,"Yes, that is from Disney right?"
0,"Disney owns them, but they do their own work."
0,I highly recommend the movie Up.
0,It's a heart warming journey with a little boy and his talking dog.
0,They float their house with balloons and go on an adventure.
0,Is that the one with the older man as well?
0,"Yes, very colorful and little sad at first but a fun journey."
0,Would you prefer something less modern?
0,No I think that would be great.
0,"I haven't watched it because it looked sad, but I think I'll give it a try."
0,"Hmm it seems that I can't recommend up at the moment, but here is a similar title called The BFG"
0,I have seen that movie before.
1,Is there anything else you can recommend?
0,"Sure, going back to my animated recommendations Ratatouille is fantastic."
0,About a mouse that wants to become a chef and moves to paris
0,That sounds interesting.
0,Is it funny?
0,Very much so.
0,It's has a 96/100 metacritic score and won an Oscar
0,"Ok, perfect!"

0,A high school girl writes letters to a bunch of her crushes.
0,"Unknowingly, they all get sent to every individual boy!"
0,The movie is all about her discovering relationships and having boys interested in her for the first time.
0,"She has to choose one of them though, who will it be?"
0,OH WOW!
0,I know she was like OMG.
0,I am curious on how the letters got out.

0,"He's actually a hitman on the run, who has a hit out on himself!"

0,Truth tron was cray man
0,"And also check out Mad Max: Fury Road, one of the best movies of the decade."
0,Mad Max huh?
0,Sounds pretty cool Fury road makes it sound like an action movie with cars maybe?

0,A movie called QUOTATION_MARKPrimer.QUOTATION_MARK
0,It's an independent film about two engineers that discover time travel and it ends up causing them serious problems.
0,"Sounds cool, do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one?"
0,It was great.
0,"It was sort of confusing trying to keep all the timelines straight, but I enjoyed it."
0,I like all sorts of movies and genres.
0,I do really enjoy time travel though (love Back to the Future and Terminator).
0,My favorite genre is probably psychological thrillers.
0,"Got it, I will try to find a recommendation."
0,I just really like movies in general.
0,"Action, Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Horror, Sci-Fi."
0,"Oddly though, I don't really get into Comic Book movies."
0,"I didn't grow up with comics, so I think I missed out on something, but I just don't get excited about all the Marvel movies and stuff."
0,I don't like comic book movies either.
0,Mad respect for you.
0,What's your favorite movie?
0,Back to the Future Part 1
0,That's an awesome movie!
0,I recommend the movie No Country for Old Men.
0,I think you will like the movie.
0,Sure.
0,I would watch the trailer for that.
0,Hope you like the movie
0,Thanks!
0,"As I said, I just generally enjoy most movies, so I'm willing to give anything a try really."
0,Thanks for the recommendation.
0,I am eager for you to send me the trailer.
0,I selected the trailer for you.
0,Thank you.
0,Nice chatting with you.
0,Have a good day!
0,Thanks you too
0,"If you like Time Travel, I recommend Primer to you."
0,But it might take a couple viewings to really get it.
0,"Luckily, it's relatively short."
0,"Thanks, did you like the trailer I sent you?"
0,It looks very interesting.
0,I think I'll watch the whole movie.
0,I usually like Tommy Lee Jones.
0,And I really liked Javier Bardem in Skyfall.
0,Hello!
0,I am here to help you find a movie to watch!
0,"Great, I love movies."
1,Anything you can recommend?
1,I've been watching a lot of science fiction movies recently.
0,"Well, my absolute favorite movie of all time is Interstellar, and it's pretty science fiction(y)-- have you ever seen it?"
0,"Yes, I have seen it."
0,"Great movie, Matthew McConaughey is a good actor."
0,So was Anne Hathaway.
0,I completely agree-- the entire movie just blew my mind because it's science fiction but it's honestly something that actually could happen one day.
0,"But if you've already seen that, then let's focus on finding you something new!"
0,What's the last movie you watched and what did you like or not like about it?
0,"I recently watched the 1st avengers movie, I especially liked the Incredible Hulk."
0,Reminds me of my childhood.
0,"Ah, the Avengers movies are so good!"
0,I personally adore the Avengers Universe and I think my favorite movie so far has been Spiderman Homecoming with Tom Holland as Spiderman.
0,Have you seen that movie?
0,"No I haven't, the last Spiderman I watched were the ones with Toby McGuire."
0,"I watched the ones with Toby McGuire when I was younger, and those are amazing too."
0,But I actually really love what they have done with the new version of Spiderman.
0,"In Spiderman Homecoming, Peter Parker is kind of like a geeky, weak high-school student who doesn't have a lot going for him until he becomes Spiderman!"
0,"It's a refreshing twist on Spiderman in my opinion; it's a retelling, not a replacement for Toby McGuire's famous Spiderman!"
0,Perhaps I should watch the newer ones.
0,"Right now I'm wondering why Spiderman wasn't included in the avengers, wasn't he also a Stan Lee creation?"
0,"He was-- Spiderman actually shows up in the third Avenger Movie, Avengers: Infinity War."
0,"I think he was an addition that they hadn't thought of before, so they introduced him first in Captain America: Civil War before he was actually in Spiderman: Homecoming."
0,"But yes, he is introduced in the third Avengers movie and then he is in all of the subsequent Avenger's movies!"
0,"I plan to watch the rest of the avengers movies, it'll be interesting to see how Spiderman affects the movie."
1,"I also watched Captain Marvel the other day, I enjoyed the performance by Brie Larson, and Samuel Jackson is always good."
0,Then I think my final recomendation will actually be Avengers: Age of Ultron.
0,"I know you like science fiction and the Avengers, so I feel like this is logically the next best movie for you to watch!"
0,"Spiderman isn't in this movie, but he appears in the next one; however, you have to watch the Avengers movies in order to understand what's going on in them."
0,So what do you think?
0,"Yeah, I'll take you up on the recommendation to watch Age of Ultron."
0,Did you notice they are also making a movie about Black Widow?
0,I enjoyed that character from The Avengers
0,I did!
0,Doesn't Scarlette Johanson star as Black Widow?
0,"I don't know a lot about her storyline, but she is definitely amazing in her role as Black Widow!"
0,"She appears in the subsequent Avenger's movies as well, so you should enjoy her in those."
0,"Yes, Scarlett Johansson."
0,"I remember seeing her in a movie called The Horse Whisperer, it was a sad movie."
0,But Scarlett Johansson gave a nice performance.
0,It may have been one of her 1st movies.
0,I actually just
1,"I'm trying to think of what else she has appeared in, all I can think of is The Island"
0,I just saw Jojo Rabbit in theaters and she stars as the mother of Jojo.
0,The story takes place in Nazi Germany during World War II and she is great in her role as the mother of the boy.
0,"If you ever have time, Jojo Rabbit is still in theaters and it's a must see!"
0,"I haven't heard of Jojo Rabbit, is a drama?"
0,War movie?
0,"Yeah, it's a comedy movie about a little boy in Nazi Germany who has Hitler as an imaginary friend."
0,"After he finds out that his mom is hiding a Jewish girl in their house, he slowly changes his ideologies to fit less with Hitler's."
0,It's a great movie and I'd highly recommend.
0,"But yes, it was great talking with you!"
0,"I hope that you have a great time watching the next Avenger's movies, but firstly, Avengers: Age of Ultron!"
0,"Okay, thank you for the recommendation."
0,Looking forward to seeing the trailer

0,I have seen several movies lately that I would recommend.
1,I love movies and would love to hear your recommendations.
0,"If you like mystery/whodunit movies, I would recommend Knives Out."
0,"It has a great cast, twist and turns, and a bit of dark comedy."
0,I did see Knives Out and I definitely enjoyed it.
0,I do enjoy a mystery.
0,"I also enjoy horror, drama, and comedy."
1,I watch a  lot of movies but some have certainly fallen through the cracks for me.
0,Glad you enjoyed it too.
0,"Wow, so you appreciate many genres!"
0,Another movie I loved was Uncut Gems with Adam Sandler.
0,it is quite a departure from what you are used to seeing from Sandler.
0,I also didn't see the ending coming from a mile away which I really appreciate.
0,I am aware of that one but have not seen it.
0,I have been meaning to but the director's last movie Good Time was also well received and I hated it so I have been unsure.
0,I would tell you to give it a shot.
0,Sandler is really good in it and I think he got robbed by not getting nominated for an Oscar.
0,"The supporting characters are great as well, and Kevin Durant's role is not just a cameo, he is integral part of the story."
0,Definitely recommend it.
0,I am curious.
0,Good Time was suspenseful but I found myself very bored.
0,Did you feel that way at all about Uncut Gems?
0,What kind of tone did you get from it?
0,Not at all.
0,It is dark for sure.
0,"It moves pretty fast, and Sandler is constantly going."
0,"It kind of made me nervous/anxious at times because some scenes are chaotic, but that is part of the narrative."
0,"I saw it with my family, husband and two early-twenties boys and we all really like it."
0,Good to know.
0,That makes me more interested.
0,Did you know who any of the other actors were because he is the only one I have heard anything about?
0,Yes.
0,Indina Manzel (sp?)
0,is his wife and Judd Hirsh is his father-in-law.
0,"The other actors are people who I have seen in other things, but don't know them by name but you will recognize them."
0,I am familiar with them.
0,Judd Hirsh is a very good actor.
0,Absolutely....all the way back to his Taxi days!
0,"Yes, I am that old!"
0,Ha ha.
0,I'm somewhere in between.
0,"I saw it when I was very, very young."
0,"Well i hope you take me up on my recommendation and see Uncut Gems, if only to see Sandler's amazing performance."
0,You have convinced me.
0,I would like to see it now and am sure I will soon.
0,Great!
0,Enjoy the rest of your day!
0,Thank you.

0,Hello!
0,Can I help you find a movie trailer?
0,"Yes, please!"
1,I want to see a movie over the holidays and I'm curious about what you might suggest and I'm looking for a recommendation.
0,Are you wanting a holiday themed movie or are you open to other ideas as well?
0,I'm open to other ideas.
0,I tend to like action movies and I can't stand horror flicks.
0,Too scary.
0,I like it when movies have a lot of character development.
0,I don't like horror either!
0,Way too scary.
0,What was the last movie that you watched?
0,The last movie I watched was Captain Marvel and I really liked it.
0,Yes!
0,Great movie.
0,Let me see what I can find that I think you will like.
0,Awesome.
0,"Like I said, I like action films and I typically like nerdy films like Star Wars or Marvel stuff."
0,I like witty humor and banter rather than slap-stick type humor.
0,"I like a complex, yet understandable plot."
1,Nothing too QUOTATION_MARKout thereQUOTATION_MARK like Inception or anything.
0,21 Bridges just released and is a movie I definitely want to see.
0,With all the hype surrounding officer involved shootings it has a lot of interest in my opinion.
0,"Hmm, I've never heard of it."
0,What's the gist?
0,I'm assuming about police shooting people?
0,I tend to get annoyed if movies try to push too hard on a political agenda.
0,It's about the opposite.
0,2 officers are shot in NY and the 21 bridges surrounding the city are shut down as the fugitives are on the run.
0,"Oh, wow."
0,I never really would have thought it would have been the opposite.
0,Interesting.
0,Is it a true story or just fiction?
0,It's fiction.
0,And I had the plot a little bit backwards.
0,2 fugitives are on the run.
0,7 officers are killed.
0,Chadwick Boseman stars as the lead detective which is a cool tie to your love of Marvel type movies!
0,"Oh wow, yeah, that sounds like my type of movie."
0,I will definitely go see it considering that plot and that actor.
0,Thanks for your recommendation!
0,I'll go see that movie over the holiday.
0,Great!
0,I hope you really enjoy it and have a happy holiday!
0,"For sure, thanks."
0,You're welcome!
0,"One last thing, I suppose."
0,I was also considering seeing Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.Do you think 21 Bridges would be a better movie?
0,Oh that's a tough one!
0,Star Wars is a great franchise and I would hate for you to miss out on that in the theater setting.
0,"For me though, I would prefer 21 Bridges and reserve Star Wars for another day."
0,"Hmm, maybe it would be a good idea to see both of them?"
0,"But, I still think I'll see 21 Bridges since you recommended it."
0,Yes definitely both if you can swing it!
0,Perfect.
0,Thanks again for your help and have a great rest of your day.

0,"Like Adventure, Fantasy, but not Disney?"

1,Are there any animal as main character movies?

0,"It's very imaginative, creative and awe inspiring."

0,They've developed a technology to suit themselves to conform into their culture and they explore a new world and make friends with the people.
0,And what is Jack and the Giant Beanstalk about?
0,I actually don't have the trailer for that.
0,Here's the Google results.
0,"When young farmhand Jack (Nicholas Hoult) unwittingly opens a portal between his realm and a race of giants, it rekindles an ancient war."
0,"Roaming Earth for the first time in centuries, the fearsome giants seek to reclaim the land they lost long ago."
0,"Jack has to face an army of foes that he thought existed only in legend, but through his arduous fight for the kingdom and its people, he may win the love of a brave princess, perhaps becoming a legend himself."
0,"Well, avatar would be okay then."
0,It's a good movie for the kids if they like animated beings and stuff.

0,Jim Carrey is hilarious!
0,"oh ya, that was a classic that I have not seen in years."
0,Jim Carey used to be my favorite
0,It would be a funny world if people could not lie.
0,Jim Carrey portrayed what that world would be like and it was hilarious.
0,I agree totally.
0,It would turn the world upside down
0,That's the first that came to mind when you said you wanted to see a comedy.
0,That was a comedy classic.
0,I would like to watch that movie again since it has been such a long time since I have seen it.
0,So would you like to watch the movie trailer?

0,Hello!
0,I would like to help you by recommending a movie trailer
0,"Please, go ahead."
0,what kind of movies do you like?
0,Action movies.
0,Great!
0,What was the most recent action movie you saw?
0,"A John Wayne western, McClintock."
0,I have never seen that movie.
0,What was your favorite part of the movie?
1,The western genre is interesting to me.
0,Do you like just old Western movies or more modern ones as well?
1,"Mostly older ones, some newer ones have been good also."
0,I'm ready to make a recommendation
1,Go ahead.
0,The Hateful Eight
0,I have not seen this movie.
0,It's a Quintin Tarantino Movie
0,"I have heard of it, just not seen it yet."
0,Is it extra violent?
0,"it's pretty violent, it takes place in the winter probably in the 1800s in the wild west."
1,"I don't like graphic violence, which is why I tend toward the older westerns."
0,Then how about this moive:  Hostiles.
0,It's a western; cowboys and indians without a lot of violence
0,"I have seen parts of this movie, not the whole thing though."
0,hi
0,Hello
0,I'm here to help you look for a movie that may fit your interests
0,"Great, thank you."
0,I like a lot of different kinds of movies.
0,"Not gory, but suspense is great."
0,I don't mind psychological thrillers but not slasher or horror movies.
0,I also really enjoy period movies like Downton Abby and that type.
0,That's awesome
1,"I also enjoy some romantic comedies, but not ones that are too QUOTATION_MARKfluffyQUOTATION_MARK or QUOTATION_MARKhigh school QUOTATION_MARKishQUOTATION_MARK"
0,"Yeah, I totally understand that."
0,I definitely think psychological thrillers are great.
0,"Have you seen some of the very popular ones, I don't know, like Shutter Island for example?"
0,"Actually no, I haven't seen that one."
0,What's the basis of that?
0,It's about a detective who is investigating a missing patient at an asylum on an island
0,That sounds good...right up my alley.
0,Not too many blood and guts?
0,"No, definitely not."
0,There's very little of that.
0,"Like, you see some guy get beat up a bit for one scene, but for the most part it's all about the story and dialogue."
0,It's a great movie.
0,That sounds great.
0,I actually think I'll watch it tonight!!
0,Thanks for the suggestion!
0,You're welcome.
0,Have a great night!!
1,Any other suggestions before I go?
0,"No, not really."
0,But Shutter Island is also a bit older.
0,Have you seen QUOTATION_MARKIt Comes at Night?QUOTATION_MARK
0,"No, I haven't seen that one either."
0,What's that one about?
0,I wonder if I can find Shutter Island on Netflix.
0,It's also really good.
0,"There's a bit more blood in that one, but only briefly."
0,And it isn't like the gory slasher kind of blood scene
0,Is it more sci-fi?
0,Or detective?
0,"So maybe a little more sci-fi, but not too much."
0,The setting of the movie is after some disease has unfortunately wiped out most of the population.
0,"There is no real form of government, so people are looking after themselves and looking out for potential threats (mostly from other people trying to survive)."
0,But it's really more so from the perspective of this very shielded/protected teenager
0,"Oh, that sounds good too."
0,I have watched a couple of other QUOTATION_MARKvirusQUOTATION_MARK type movies like that.
0,Survival and everything...they're good.
0,Thanks for the recommendations.
0,I'm going to check out both of those.
0,That's awesome.

0,i like the cast and the story seems interesting so ill probably go see it
0,"Cool, i haven't seen it yet either, but i intend to."
0,There's just too many things coming out recently for me to keep up

0,Yes isn't that interesting?
0,I am glad that someone else sees that connection as well.
0,"Both are a great series, just takes a long time to finish them!"
0,"Yes I think both series also set a standard for having multiple sequels to movies now, mostly as a cash grab, since I don't think their have been many series that have come out recently that are that interesting."
0,I think after Hunger Games we haven't really had any good movie series come out that weren't piggybacking off of the Hunger Games dystopia hype.

0,A series actually.
0,"Rocky, watched all of them just because I enjoy rewatching them."
0,"Oh, that's very nice!"
0,Sylvester Stallone is an amazing actor.
0,Is action your favorite type of genre for movies?
0,"Not necessarily, though I do enjoy it."
1,I'd say romantic comedy is my favorite next to scifi.
0,"Sweet, I'm more of a rom-com kind of person as well."
0,Would you like to watch a movie that is a romantic comedy?
1,"Yeah, I'll definitely be willing to hear your recommendation(s)."
0,To All the Boys I Loved Before is a very sweet film with some cute comedy involved.
0,"It's a Netflix original that will have your heart melted and also, tears from laughing so much."
0,I remember watching this with my partner and it really was enjoyable for the two of us.
0,"In addition, Noah Centineo is an upcoming actor himself."
0,I've been seeing him in a couple of shows and movies after watching this one!

0,I will most definitely be checking it out!
0,Awesome to hear!
1,Any other movies I should check out?
0,"Another movie to definitely check out is, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates."
0,"It is a bit older than the first one I recommended, however, it is star-studded with Zac Efron and Adam Devine."
0,It's almost a given that it will be another great movie to watch as Zac Efron steals hearts and Adam Devine has a huge comedian side to him.
0,Super cute and funny to watch!
0,That's not too old.
0,"People give Zac Efron a lot of flack, but I think he's usually a good fit for a comedy."
0,Right?
0,"I agree as well, he actually is a versatile actor."
0,I know Zac Efron is a great actor in most of the romantic comedies he's in.
0,But he also shows multiple sides to him in some of his action and suspenseful movies.
0,I think Zac Efron is underrated for the wrong reasons.
0,I've seen Adam Devine in QUOTATION_MARKWhy Him?QUOTATION_MARK
0,which honestly was one of the funniest movies I've seen.
0,That movie was pretty hilarious!
0,That's another star-studded film.
0,One of my favorite actors is Bryan Cranston.
0,"If you enjoyed that one with Adam Devine, you will certainly enjoy Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates!"
0,Definitely checking that out.
0,Wouldn't mind a laugh or two right now.

0,"I am good, how are you?"
0,enjoying a quiet day.
0,Oh cool.
0,So what's your favorite movie?
0,"probably ronin, how about you?"
0,I think my favorite movie would be Catch Me If You Can.
0,Have you seen it?
0,no what's it about?
0,"The main character (Leonardo DiCaprio) master of deception, he was also a brilliant forger, whose skill gave him his first real claim to fame: At the age of 17, Frank Abagnale, Jr. became the most successful bank robber in the history of the U.S. FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) makes it his prime mission to capture Frank and bring him to justice, but Frank is always one step ahead of him."

0,"I have not actually, i really want to though!"
0,What is it about?
0,"its about three girls who get kidnapped by a man with 23 personalities, and they must some how escape"
0,That sounds interesting!
0,I definitely need to watch it!
0,Sounds just like my genre of movies I like!
0,What's your favorite genre?
0,"probably thriller,"
0,Gotcha.
0,Well cool.
0,I'd say I agree with myself on that too!
0,I saw once upon time in Hollywood recently that was good and interesting
0,Ohh yes that's a great movie!
0,I love watching movies with Leonardo!
0,He's a great actor!
0,he is very talented
0,"Very, well thank you for your recommendations!"
0,Hello
0,Hi!
1,Could you recommend a movie to me?
0,Yup!
0,First what kind of movies do you like?
0,"Action, drama, superhero, etc..."
1,I really like suspense and drama movies.
0,The last great suspense movie I saw was Parasite.
0,"It was a really great blend of dark comedy, suspense and drama."
0,Really!
0,everyone i know has been recommending me that movie.
0,I just haven't watched the trailer plus I don't know what is about.
0,"It's a fantastic film about aspiration, greed and the perception of power in the world."
0,"It's a Korean language film, and was the first foreign film in history to win an Academy Award for Best Picture."
0,Now i want to watch it!
0,"Since you like suspenseful movies, I recommend watching Doctor Sleep."
0,The film is dark but has funny aspects to it.
0,"Plus its the sequel the original, The Shining."
1,I'm a big fan of Steven King and I loved The Shining.
0,Thank you!
0,I'll definitely watch it.
0,Yup!
0,I love his movies.
0,"If you have Netflix definetely watch, In the Tall Grass."
0,It's super trippy and keeps you guessing even after the film is over.
0,I had to look up YouTube videos that explained the movie.
0,LOL
0,"I'll check that one out, too."
0,Thanks again!
0,No problem.
0,I'm a huge movie person.
0,I like almost all genres except gruesome horror like the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw.
0,I can't handle those.
0,I like thriller more just because it keeps you thinking.
0,Since you like suspense i also recommend watching Split.
0,I just watched Split recently!
0,I like James McAvoy and I really like that trilogy of films with Unbreakable and Glass.
0,"I don't really like any of the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw films, either."
1,I'm more of a fan of psychological thrillers.
0,That trilogy was really good.
0,i think it took the director 10 plus years to make the sequel for Unbreakable.
0,"Honestly, I'm glad Split came out later because the technology they had back in the day did not do movies justice compared to now."
0,That's so true.
0,I think it there are so many movies that could have benefited from the graphics technology these days.
0,"But sometimes, I think movies like Star Wars rely too much on the graphics and don't put enough emphasis on the story and character development and interaction."
0,"I wasn't 100% satisfied with the latest Star Wars trilogy, and that's sad because I'm a huge Star Wars fan."
0,YES!!
0,"To be honest though, I like more and more movies coming out don't have enough originality."
0,So movie company rather throw in an explosion or two just to make the more captivating.
0,I totally agree.
1,I really appreciate action movies that have a great plot and character development.
0,Sorry for my lack of words the last comment.
0,I reread what I typed and it made no sense.
0,"Yes, action movies are great but almost all the actions movies that are released are comic book based or unoriginal."
0,I have yet to see a movie that's  not based on a book or a documentary of some kind.
0,That's true.
0,Maybe because they're the easiest to merchandise.
0,I feel like that's a big consideration of production companies these days.
0,One original action movie that I saw recently was another Korean film called The Man From Nowhere.
0,There's a great sub-genre of Korean action films that just focus on revenge.
0,Do you know any other films like that?
0,"No, I don't know any films like that."
0,"I usually don't watch foreign films, mostly because of the subtitles."
0,"Although, all the films you've been recommending seem super interesting."
0,"All of the films you recommended seem great, too."
0,I'll be sure to watch them.

0,Have you seen Batman vs Superman?
0,No...i haven't seen
0,What about Justice League?
0,No..i haven't seen that too
0,Okay.
0,"If you watch Batman vs Superman you get some good background on Batman, but you don't have to watch it to get Aquaman."
0,"Justice League gives a good intro to the Aquaman character, but again, you don't have to see it to enjoy Aquaman."
0,I just think his parts in the movie are hilarious and give you a feel for the character.
0,hmm....im very eager to watch

0,"Oh okay, sounds like a very interesting plot."
0,I accept your recommendation.
0,Well the sequel looks great so I think you will also like the original!

1,Do you have any other recommendations?
0,Yes!
0,A new movie called The Lovebirds!
0,In this a couple basically are accidentally involved in a murder and are trying to solve it to clear their name.
0,"Wow, what a plot twist!"
0,That one sounds very interesting as well.
0,Do you know who stars in this movie?
0,Yes that has Kumail Nanjiani and Issa Rae!
0,"Okay, I am not very familiar with those two actors."
1,"So, I may have to reject this recommendation."
0,"Gotcha, theres also a movie called The Prom, it has Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, James Corden, Ariana DeBose, Kerry Washington, Andrew Rannells, and Awkwafina!"
0,What is the plot of this movie?
0,"Well actually maybe thats not great, its more of a musical, how about The Office Mixup?"
0,A woman pretends to be a corporate executive after a case of mistaken identity at her workplace.
1,"No, I think I will have to reject that recommendation."
0,"Ok,there is a movie called QUOTATION_MARKIsn't It RomanticQUOTATION_MARK with Rebel Wilson, Natalie is a New York architect who works hard to get noticed at her job, but is more likely to deliver coffee and bagels than design the city's next skyscraper."
0,Things go from bad to weird when she gets knocked unconscious during a subway mugging and magically wakes up to find herself in an alternate universe.
0,"Always cynical about love, Natalie's worst nightmare soon comes true when she suddenly discovers that she's playing the leading lady in a real-life romantic comedy."

1,Do you have anymore that you could recommend?
0,Hi there!
0,I hear you're a big fan of movies
0,I am!
0,My husband and I enjoy watching together - usually action-based.
1,"Inside that genre, we're pretty open though - thriller, comedy, sci-fi - we enjoy most movies that move fast and keep us on our toes."
0,Awesome!
0,Action movies are my favorite genre as well.
0,What was the last action movie you saw in theaters?
0,Super hero something...I don't quite recall.
0,We usually watch at home since we have a son on the spectrum and a huge TV to accommodate our movie enjoyment.
0,Yeah I know what you mean.
0,Getting out to the movies is tough with kids.
0,Have you seen the new Bad Boys movie with Will Smith?
0,No.
0,I enjoyed the first one though.
0,It should be entertaining.
1,I like most of Will Smith's work.
0,"If you liked the first one, I would definitely recommend watching the new one."
0,I think it was as good as the first and better than the second.
0,"Fast paced action and, of course, lots of explosions."

0,But since it is not due out for a couple of months would you be interested in watching a trailer for Bad Boys for Life?
0,Are there any other super hero movies out now?
0,"We may catch Bad Boys for Life at home sometime, but the Marvel movies tend to have more depth, some unexpected plot twists or character shifts."
0,"Bad Boys is pretty straightforward, and while it's a fun trip, it's one we probably won't pay to see in theatres."
0,"There aren't many superhero movies out right now, but you might enjoy Birds of Prey."
0,It's a comic book based movie starring Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn.
0,These aren't Marvel movies but most people that enjoy the Marvel series enjoy these as well.
0,Would you like to see a movie trailer?
0,Sure.
0,She was an interesting character.
0,I'd like to know more.
0,"Well, I wasn't able to find the movie trailer for Birds of Prey but I've selected the Suicide Squad trailer for you to watch."
0,"It has the main character of Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn, in it as well."
0,It should give you a good idea of what to expect with the new movie.
0,Does that work for you?
0,Yes.
0,I accept.
0,Show me the trailer.
0,Perfect.
0,Here's a little background information on the trailer:  secret government agency recruits some of the most dangerous incarcerated super-villains to form a defensive task force.
0,Their first mission: save the world from the apocalypse.
0,Sounds entertaining.
1,"Anything else you can recommend if we need a back-up plan (we live in a college town, and sometimes movies get sold out quickly.)"
0,"If you're a fan of Guy Ritchie movies, such as Snatch or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, I would recommend going to see his latest movie, The Gentlemen."

1,I enjoy thriller or mystery movies
0,I've enjoyed Christopher Nolan thrillers; what do you like about mysteries
0,Oh nice he's the guy that made the batman movies right?
0,I just like not knowing what is about to happen and then having to rewatch the movie so I can find out if I could have solved the mystery the first time watching it
0,"Yes, he made the Dark Knight films and some thriller/mystery types like QUOTATION_MARKMementoQUOTATION_MARK and QUOTATION_MARKInceptionQUOTATION_MARK"

0,Did you see Get Out or Us at all?
0,Peele's been making waves in the horror scene and would like to hear your opinion on the films if you've seen them
0,I somehow keep managing to forget to watch both of those.
0,Is there one that you'd recommend above the other?
0,Get Outs plot is way stronger but Lupita Nyongo's performance in Us is superb and terrifying.
0,If you're looking to be more scared I'd recommend Us.
0,A strong plot is definitely important.
0,I think I'll go with Get Out and follow with Us if I like the former.
0,Awesome.
0,"The plot to Get Out is superb and once your done definitely check out an interview with Peele, there are so many hidden double meanings and symbols."
0,Its not jump-scare-y but definitely unnerving and well done.
0,Definitely worth watching
0,I like the psychological stuff for sure.
0,"I've always liked Peele, thought he was the funniest of those two for sure."
0,Glad to see him working in films.
0,"Me too, that guy is so smart, I'm glad he's getting the recognition he deserves."

0,"I definitely accept that one, gave me the extra push to finally watch it."
0,Neat!
0,Happy to help.
0,I'll grab that trailer for ya.

0,One of my favorite Coen Brothers films is Miller's Crossing.
0,It seems lesser known than their other movies.
0,Have you seen it?
0,"I have not, I will have to look in to it"
0,I think the movie highlights the Coen Brother's ability to make a compelling movie even toward the beginning of their carreer.

0,I didn't like the weak story.
0,Are animated movies a big draw for you?
0,"I think so, I like animation as a medium form."
0,"Are there any particular voice actors that you like in animated movies, or is it more just about the quality of the story?"
1,"I think it's more about the quality to me, I don't care much about who's in a movie."
0,Do you like rewatching old animation movies sometimes for fun?
0,Or only the newest ones?
1,"I love the older ones, the newer ones aren't as good."
0,"If you like going back and watching older classics, I would recommend that you rewatch Beauty and the Beast!"

0,It's really great!
0,Which one is your favorite of the Disney films?

0,It's great!
0,"I remember being very excited to see it, the marketing build up for it was huge that summer."
0,It's sad that it didn't get the reception it deserved.
0,"I agree, thanks for your recommendation though!"
0,It's also good.
0,"Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer is there any movies you'd like to see the trailers of ?"
1,I want to see a movie that is full of twists and turns and more about the plot than relationships or sex
0,hmm what about Carrie (1976) the twist ending in this movie is both impossible and too terrifying to forget.
0,"Carrie is good, but I want something with more of a twist like the village or the uninvited I want something that is scary, but not all blood and gore, but more mind blowing, like... wow didn't think that would happen."
1,can i recommend maybe geralds game its not a blood & gore movie more of like a psycological horror thriller suspense.
0,its about a woman who accidentally kills her husband during a kinky game and shes left hand cuffed to the bed and starts seeing strange things figures etc its pretty good movie and i think itll fit what youre looking for

0,"Yes, not so much action, but more dialogue."
0,Are you familiar with Martin Scorsese movies?
0,"Yeah, I like Scorsese."
0,"Ok, this is one of his newest films."

0,I DeNiro in it?
0,He does a lot of Scorsese flicks.
0,"Yes, DeNiro is the lead, also with Al Pacino and Joe Pesci"

0,This movie explores Sheeran's relationships with the Bufalino family and with Hoffa.
0,It also explains why he became a hit man and how he became a high official in the labor union.

0,Why would you say that it?
0,I feel that movies that are more recent are able to be portrayed more accurately.

0,I agree.
1,I do enjoy movies that are surrounding World War II.
1,I also like to watch documentaries.
0,Did you see Dunkirk?
0,I did not see that movie.

0,I am going to strongly recommend Hacksaw Ridge

0,"edge of tomorrow is with tom cruise, are you familiar with it?"
0,"I am not, though I like tom cruise movies."
0,this was a great movie about fighting aliens and reliving the same day (a bit like groundhog day).
0,"its called edge of tomorrow, but it was also known as live, die, repeat (which pretty much tells you what its about)"
0,Interesting.
0,Did the movie have different names in different markets?
0,"yes, live, die, repeat was the movie's tagline, but went by that name in other markets."

0,I saw looper and really liked it.
0,Looper is a good recommendation.
0,I also liked inception.
0,Are there anymore like that?
0,"cant mention time travel assassins without bringing up terminator or terminator 2...a real interesting take on the action/futuristic space genre is hardcore henry, the entire movie is shot first person"

0,I'll check out both terminator and terminator 2.
0,I accept your recommendation.
0,"thanks, glad i could help!"

0,I have never heard of those two.
0,What are they about?

0,Have you seen the Matrix!?
0,That is a mind boggling sci fi movie!!
0,Definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat.
0,Would you believe it...
0,I have fallen asleep every time I've tried to watch it??
0,I don't know why.
0,Maybe it's because I don't really like Keanu Reeves.
0,That could be!
0,Another one that was very entertaining was Blade Runner.
0,It has Harrison Ford like in the Star Wars movies!
0,What's it about?
0,"A blade runner must pursue and terminate four replicants, which are like robots created to help society and look/act like humans, who stole a ship in space."

0,"But I found that one to be absolutely tasteful, not overly done at all for what they had in it!"
0,May I also recommend more of a suspense film that is a little more on the side of ghosts and hauntings than vampires?

1,"I love Frank Henenlotter flicks, pretty much anything along those lines"
0,I will have to check him out.
0,"So, outside of B movie horror what else do you like to watch"
0,I suppose I sometimes like QUOTATION_MARKfeel goodQUOTATION_MARK movies but pretty much everything I watch is along some weird eclectic line.
0,I recently Bad Taste and it blew my mind I hadn't seen it before.
0,I think I can recommend something you may like
1,I look forward to it!
0,:D
0,Have you ever seen the Purge it is not a feel good but you make like it
0,I watched like half of it but I'll give it another try if you recommend it.

0,Oh lawd I hope it's Cabin in the Woods campy XD
0,Not like that but that is a good movie.
0,I will give it one more try just because you said so :P thank you for your recommendation
0,You are welcome
0,"I feel like I'm going to get to the exact same point in the movie and then wonder why I decided to try it again when I knew it was junk to begin with lol I won't curse you, promise hahaha"
0,Hello!
0,How are you today?
0,I'm doing really good.
0,How are you?
0,"Great, thanks for asking!"
0,I hope I can find you a good movie trailer.
0,Do you know what kind of movie you'd like to see?
1,"I like romantic comedies best, but I also like movies based on true events."
0,What was the last romantic comedy you watched?
0,"The Wedding Singer, with Adam Sandler."
0,He's one of my favorites.
0,The music is always great in his movies.
0,Cool!
0,Haven't seen that one in forever.
0,So are you looking for something similar?
0,Yes!
0,"I like that endearing hopefulness, with the really sweet, good guy."
0,"You know the kind, where love just sort of sneaks up on them!"
0,Do you like Ben Stiller or Cameron Diaz?
0,I like them both!
1,They both seem to have very sweet character portrayals.
0,"If you haven't seen There's Something About Mary, I highly recommend it."
0,"It stars them both and it's really funny, some of the jokes can be a little bit dirty though."
0,I can tell you more about it if you'd like.
0,I've heard some really good reviews about that one.
0,I'd love to hear more about it.
0,"And I don't mind some of the dirty jokes, in the interest of comedy--I'll just be sure to watch it after the kids have gone to bed."
0,I accept this recommendation.
0,"Tell me more about it, please."
0,"Ben Stiller was a bit of a dork in high school and manages to get a prom date with a really attractive girl (Diaz), however the date goes awry in hilarious fashion."
0,Years later he gets a chance to meet up with her again and kind of start over.
0,"Lots of complications though and the way he goes about it is kinda dodgy, but his heart is true."
0,So is the attractive girl nice or antagonistic in this movie?
0,Does she seem to like Ben or does she treat him as though he's beneath her level.
0,She's actually super sweet and part of the reason she liked Ben's character in the beginning is because he had a sweet heart and got along well with her special needs brother.
0,"She's a bit of a guy's girl when she's older, into sports, beer, etc..."
0,Cool--sounds interesting.
0,I'd love to watch it.
0,I accept your recommendation!
0,"There's also a little band that sort of breaks the third wall and plays throughout the story, I always thought that was kind of neat."
0,"The supporting cast is really good too, Matt Dillon and Lee Evans have great side characters competing for Mary's affection."
0,"Great, I'll link the trailer is just a moment."
0,Okay--I'll wait.
0,I do enjoy a story that has little sidelines in it!
0,The band sort of lightly chronicles the story so far.
0,"Anyway, the trailer should be on the way after this."
0,I hope you enjoy the film.
0,Take care.
0,Thanks.
0,"You, too!"

0,Is it available for streaming yet I wonder?
0,I love Seth Rogan in everything he does!
0,Pineapple Express was great!
0,It is!
0,It is streaming on Amazon Prime Video.
0,It has so much of the classic Seth Rogan humor in it and adds a light hearted take on the whole North Korean situation.
0,It is definitely a watch over and over again movie.
0,I've seen it four times!
0,This is a perfect recommendation.
0,I'm going to put it on right now!
0,Thank you so much for a great movie recommendation!
0,No Problem!
0,I hope you enjoy!
0,Thanks!
0,I am excited to see how it is.
0,"I like James Franco a lot, too."
0,But I've only seen him in more serious roles.
0,"I was the same way, but I feel like after this movie he should really move into more comedic roles."
0,He was outstanding.
0,But you could truly see the friendship that him and Seth have on and off the camera.
0,They played off of each other very well
0,That's awesome to hear.
0,I'm pulling it up right now.
0,I'm ready to settle in with some laughs for a while.
0,Oh you will definitely laugh throughout the movie.
0,It is so hilarious!
0,That's good.
0,I need it after the last movie I watched.
0,The - Report.
0,"OMG, it was so boring!"
0,Oh I completely agree that movie was not very interesting got me at all.
0,I just cannot get into the drama movies.
0,I am more of a Comedy/Horror movie person

0,What was the last horror movie you watched that you enjoyed the most?
0,Annabelle Comes Home
0,"what did you like most about Annabelle Come Home, and what did you dislike the most?"
0,"I liked how the girl wanted to find out if the house was haunted but shen she did, she was scared and didn't want to know anymore."
0,"Okay, so would you like a movie with a similar story, or a different one?"
0,Similar story is better.
0,The Nun
0,I've never seen it.
0,Is it really scary?
0,"It's pretty scary, would you like to know a little bit more about the movie?"
0,"Yes, I would."
0,Awesome!
0,"A priest with a evil past, and a novitiate on the brink of her final vows are sent to investigate the suicide of a young nun in romania."
0,"When they uncover the unholy secret, they risk there lives, soul, and there faith as they confront a malevolent force in the shape of a demonic nun."

1,so what do you have to recommend?

0,mostly comedies....some thrillers or drama.
0,I just saw Captain Marvel with the woman.....it was ok...my other half liked it better than me :)
0,which comedy would you recommend?
0,an old one is bridesmaids....love that movie :)
0,Have you seen number Two?

0,thank you!
0,any time it is a good film
0,Hello!
0,How are you today?
0,I'm fine thanks.
0,How are you?
0,I'm doing well.
0,I'm going to try to help you find a cool movie today.
0,What kind of movies do you like?
1,I love romantic comedies
0,Romantic comedies are awesome!
0,Have you ever seen 500 Days of Summer?
0,Yeah.
0,It was alright
0,That's one of my favorites.
0,Which one is your current favorite?
0,We're the millers
0,I love Jennifer Aniston!
0,Have you seen The Switch?
0,The switch was fantastic.
0,Jenniefer was a revelation
0,I totally agree.
0,"I love Jason Bateman too, he's such a dad and absolutely hilarious."
0,Have you seen Juno?
0,I haven't seen that one.
0,What's it about?
0,"It came out in like 2007 so it's a little older but it's about this teenage girl who accidentally gets pregnant by one of her best friends, and then how she deals with the aftermath of that."
0,I don't want to spoil it and I know it sounds cheesy but it's actually really sweet and super funny and not at all what you would probably expect out of a teen pregnancy movie.
0,I'd really like to see it.
0,It sounds interesting
0,Awesome!
0,If you decide to watch it I hope you like it!
1,Do you have any other suggestion?
0,I also really like Crazy Stupid Love because Im a big Steve Carrell fan!
0,It's about a guy having a sort of mid-life crisis after a divorce.
0,I've watched it.
0,My girlfriend has a crush on Steve Carrell from his performance in that movie.
0,"Haha, your girlfriend and I have that in common."
0,Steve Carrell is the best.
0,"So if you're interested, I can try to send you the movie trailer from Juno!"
0,I'd like that very much.
0,"Hello, I understand you like movies!"
1,"Yes, what is a comedy movie you would recommend?"
0,"Do you like romantic comedies, slapstick, or comedies with a good story?"
1,Romantic or with a good story!
0,I like witty humor.
0,Do you like old classic films that may be in black and white or do you prefer newer works?
1,I prefer newer works.
0,OK one of the really good new ones is called Longshot.
0,Have you heard of it?
0,"No, what is it about?"
0,It is a classic formula of two people from different worlds finding each other.
0,What is interesting is the actors.
0,Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron.
0,Not two people you would tend to see in a movie together
0,I guess that's why it's called QUOTATION_MARKLongshotQUOTATION_MARK.
0,I'm not sure I am interested.
0,One from earlier this year was Always Be My Maybe.
0,About two people whose paths crossed over the years but they never got together as the timing was always wrong and their destinies took them different places
0,That one sounds more interesting.
0,"Cool, one of my favorites this year was Murder Mystery with Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler."
0,The formula is the stale couple rekindling their romance but it takes place on a yacht and a murder takes place and they find themselves in the middle of trying to solve it while working out their relationship issues.
0,I can't stand Adam Sandler movies... which is unfortunate because I love Jennifer Aniston.
0,Well this one is a bit different but depends on whether you like Rebel Wilson or not.
0,"She stars as a person who hates Rom Coms, gets knocked and finds herself living the plot of a Rom Com."
0,Learning life lessons and finding love along the way.
0,I think she is a bit overrated.
0,I need a witty movie!
0,OK I am going to reach back here.
0,John Cusack stars as a professional hit man who walked out on his girlfriend just before senior prom and returns 10 years later for the reunion and to try and get back together with his girlfriend Minnie Driver.
0,He is also trying to reconcile his job with trying to have a normal life.
0,Grosse Point Blanke
0,That sounds more interesting
0,"OK, another good one from a few years ago is Chasing Amy, a Kevin Smith film starring Ben Affleck about a comic book artist who falls in love with a woman who is currently living a lesbian lifestyle."
0,Both discover a lot about themselves and has a lot of Kevin Smith type humor in it.
0,I think I will go with Grosse Point Blanke.
0,"Thanks, here is the trailer!"
0,Thank you!
0,Hi!
0,I am here to help recommend a movie for you today.
0,Great!
1,"I am looking for psychological thrillers, do you know of any good ones?"
0,I know of some really great ones.
0,Have you ever seen Donnie Darko?
0,I have not!
0,But have definitely heard of it before.
0,"I'll definitely have to check that one out, but am curious if you know of any more recent films?"
0,What about the movie QUOTATION_MARKGet Out!QUOTATION_MARK?
0,"I have been meaning to watch that one, actually."
0,I will accept that recommendation!
0,Thank you
0,Awesome!
0,Would you like to watch this movie trailer?
0,"Yes, sure!"
0,Great.
0,The trailer should begin after the chat is finished.
0,I hope you enjoy it.
0,"Ok, thanks again for the recommendation"
0,"Before we finish, are there any other movies that you also be interested in?"
0,There are a few others in the thriller category that I think that you would like.
0,"Sure, I am open to more ideas!"
0,"There was a fairly recent one that came out called Split, which also had a sequel called Glass."
0,Have you heard of either of these?
0,I haven't.
0,What are they about?
0,"Split is based on the idea that a man kidnaps three girls, but the kicker is that he has 23 unique personalities."
0,And apparently there is a 24th personality that is really horrible that has yet to come out yet.
0,So the girls try to escape before the 24th comes out.
0,Oh wow!
0,That sounds creepy and definitely thrilling.
0,What about Glass?
0,"Its the sequel to Split, and focuses on the 24th personality being used as a weapon."
0,Both of those seem like movies I would be interested in.
0,One of my favorite psychological thrillers is Shutter Island.
1,Do you know of any movies similar to that?
0,"You might like Awaken, though it is a few years old."
0,The plot is based on a random group of people waking up on an island where they are being hunted down.
0,Great!
0,I will have to check that one out too
0,I think all of them are good movies.
0,"If I had  to choose one, Get Out had the best reception among movie critics and won/was nominated for the most awards."
0,Do you still want to see that trailer?
0,Yes please.
0,"All right, I will queue it up and end the chat if that is alright with you."
0,"Perfect, thanks!"

0,Well hope you enjoy!

0,"Thank you, I accept that recommendation and will see that movie!"
0,Great!

1,"i really like action/adventure movies, and i enjoy a good horror film too."
1,do you have any suggestions?
0,"I did just watch a horror movie called Midsommar with some friends about a month ago, that one was super odd."
0,You heard of it?
0,"i have, and i've seen it too!"
0,"i agree, it was one of the strangest films i've seen in a long time."
0,i appreciate the cinematography though.
1,"since i've seen it already, do you have any other recommendations?"
0,Yeah that was a real weird experience with friends haha.
0,"Anyways, other ones I liked recently were Joker (though most people have seen that haha), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Oldie but that was great), No country for Old Men (Engaging to watch, interesting villain, and cinematography was good), and There will be Blood (super weird and quite good)"
0,"ohh, you know what, i haven't seen Joker yet but i've really been wanting to!"
0,"i've heard a lot of great reviews, and didn't it win some awards recently?"

0,Oh nice!

0,"well, thank you for the suggestions, i'll definitely watch those when i get a chance!"
0,Nice :).
0,"Since you pointed out the cinemetography in midsommar (and watched it in the first place) I imagine you're the kind of person who'll appreciate both of them for that alone, not to mention the other good aspects"
0,"oh yes, good cinematography combined with good acting are huge selling points for me when it comes to watching (and liking) a movie."
0,Well they both have unusually great acting so that'll definitely be a plus for you.

0,"the last film i saw with Phoenix in it was Signs, and he was awesome in that as well."
0,I'm not sure I've actually seen anything else he was in that I recognized at least haha.
0,"But I was thinking of looking up some other ones to see after this movie, though I got distracted and never followed through with that."
0,Maybe now I'll remember :P

0,of course.
0,it worths the efforst obviously.
0,let me show you just a quick cap from an old trailer.
0,just to emphasize my opinion
0,Okay but I would like a recommendation of a current movie then

1,"kidnapping, killing, emotional drama"
0,"OK, sounds good"
1,any recommendations?

0,Gotcha.
0,I seriously recommend that Good Boys movie that's back by Seth Rogan.
0,Its Rated R starring three little boys and their antics.
0,I think what's enjoyable about the movie is that it apologetically showcases the negative feelings people have for children.
0,It's part of the funny for sure.
0,"Oh yeah i just recently saw it, it was awesome."
0,& Honestly it kinds sucks that the Oscars are biased because of the  amount of people that love horror and everyone knows it's one of the biggest genres but at the same time oh well as long as the movies keep coming out and the people are making their money
0,yeah it's obnoxious at this point.
0,i don't think enough people care about it tho thats the sad part
0,"hi, how are you doing tonight?"
0,"I'm doing well, how are you?"
0,I am doing good.

0,Hi there!
0,Interested in seeing a movie??
0,That I am!
0,Great!
0,What kind of movies do you like?
1,"I like action, comedies, and animated movies."

0,I'm open for anything.
0,I'm not picky whatsoever.
0,Is there any movie that you've disliked?
0,Any pet peeves?
0,"I mean, there's been mediocre films, but for the most part, I can find a reason to enjoy a movie, even if for the effort or unique premise."
0,I honestly cannot recall the last film I left theaters being upset seeing.
0,You're very open minded!
0,Would you say you appreciate the production value over the acting/script?
0,They both play important roles to me.
0,A boring concept with great acting can make a decent film as much as a very unique plot with mediocre acting.
1,"Like Godzilla is giant monsters fighting, acting doesn't really matter there, or something like Hateful Eight is a half dozen people sitting in a room and talking for 3 hours, yet it was thrilling."
0,I would recommend checking out Raising Arizona if you haven't before!
0,Its a very creative and heart-felt comedy about an ex convict and his wife raising a baby.
0,"The plot sounds simple but the script is really good, as is the acting."
0,"If you're a fan of Nicholas Cage, this is one of his best performances."
0,Oh I've heard of that.
0,Coen Brothers have made several outstanding films.
0,"I may have seen this when I was younger, but I legit don't remember."
0,I'll check and see if it's on any streaming.
0,Awesome!
0,What other Cohen brother movies do you like?
0,Pretty much anything from 2000 on.
0,That's when I started watching them.
0,"I haven't seen their Netflix film, Buster Scruggs, but everything else has been a gem."
0,No Country has some of the best cinematography ever.
0,The Netflix film is pretty good.
0,Any horror movies you like?
0,"I don't mind horror, I just don't care for the ghost/paranormal stuff."
0,I like monsters or slashers.
0,The whole Grudge/Ring crazy and now Annabelle/conjuring craze just doesn't interest me.
0,It's all ghosts haunting houses.
0,"I like more creative ones like It Follows, or You're Next."
1,Hereditary and Midsommar were both fantastic.
0,It Follows was very good.
0,And I loved the themes of motherhood on Hereditary.
0,A24 has been putting out some really high-quality films this year.
0,"Yea, them and blumhouse tend to put out quality film after quality film."
0,"Check out Midsommar if you can, it's 2.5 hours, but fantastic."

0,Be sure to check out Raising Arizona.
0,I enjoyed chatting with you a lot!
0,"Yes, will do."
0,Hi!
0,Hey
0,What kind of movies do you like?
1,I love Horror Movies.
1,"Also I like Action, Thrillers and Drama."
0,What's the last horror movie you saw?
0,The last one I saw was Insidious: Last Key.
0,"Anything stand out for you, in terms of what you liked or disliked about it?"
0,I liked the fact that the woman is a psychic/medium who went back to her childhood home to get rid of the evil that she released.
0,She found out the secret of many bodies hidden in the house and her dad was a part of it.
0,I disliked how it didn't scare me or make me jump like I would like horror movies to do.
0,It still sounds like something I'd enjoy.
0,I like horror a lot too.
0,"The scariest movies I've ever seen were Event Horizon, Silent Hill and the original Nightmare on Elm Street."
0,Have you seen any of those?
0,I have seen Silent Hill and Nightmare on Elm Street.
0,I don't remember if I have seen Event Horizon.
0,"The name of the movie is familiar, but if I have seen it it has been a long time."
1,I do love the serial killer type movies too.
1,My favorite is Michael Myers.
1,He's my favorite.
0,I've never seen any of those.
0,But I highly recommend Event Horizon if you haven't seen it.
0,"It's about a warp drive engine that opens up a gateway to hell, and has some horrific scenes of demonic entities."
0,Oh heck yes.
0,Now I am more interested.
0,"Well thank you for that recommendation, I will definitely look into it"
0,Why don't you check out the trailer and see if you like it?
0,That looks like a really interesting movie to watch.
0,The trailer has me interested to find out more on the movie
0,Cool -- hope you enjoy it!
0,I will definitely watch it.
0,Thank you.
0,You bet!
0,Nice talking to you
0,Nice talking to you as well.
0,Take care.
0,You too!
0,Good bye
0,"Hi, I'm here to help recommend a movie for you."
0,"Oh, alright."
1,"So, I am thinking about something that maybe is thought-provoking but also has fantasy elements."
0,What's one movie you liked that was similar to this?
1,"Ok, so, I really like MCU and Pixar movies."
0,So you like more superhero and/or a decidedly good vs. evil kind of though provoking fantasy?
1,"Doesn't have to have be good vs. evil, I also enjoy something with an interesting premise but doesn't throw it away in the middle of it."
0,"Awesome, the movie that first came to mind and now stands out the most has definitely got to be Inception."
0,It's all fantasy and really makes you think about how they're doing what they're doing in the movie.
0,Oh yeah that movie is great.
0,Christopher Nolan is definitely my favorite director because all of his movies are thriller type movies.
0,Have you ever seen his movie The Prestige?
0,"Not yet, but I'm intersted."
0,I thought it was a great movie.
0,I'm not going to spoil anything for you.
0,"It's got so many good actors in it, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cane, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, and several more big name actors."
0,Alright I accept your recommendation.
0,I can't seem to find a trailer for this movie.
0,"Have you ever seen Memento, also directed by Christopher Nolan?"
0,"Huh, really?"
0,"Well, not that one either, what is it about?"
0,"It's a mystery thriller about a man with amnesia, more or less."
0,The movie is shown in a very unique way where it goes back and forth between present time and flashbacks as the man comes back to remembering these times.
0,My description doesn't make it sound very interesting but I really enjoyed the movie.
0,It was one of Nolan's early movies so it's often overlooked and there aren't any big name actors in it but it is a very interesting premise and I'd recommend it if you like movies that make you think
1,"Hmm, do you have another Nolan  movie in mind?"
0,"Since you like MCU movies, I'm assuming you've seen The Dark Knight trilogy, but if not I'd really recommend those even if you aren't a DC fan."
0,I like those movies.
0,The only other Nolan movie I can think of that I've seen that fits what you like would be Interstellar.

0,"Better than some, worse than others."
0,Thanks for asking!
0,You are most welcome.
0,lol :) Do you like movies and if so which genre?
0,I love movies.
1,"Science fiction is probably my favorite, followed by action/drama or action/thriller."
0,which film have you seen recently?
0,i love that genre also
0,"It's probably not the last science fiction film I've seen, but the one that comes to mind first is Blade Runner 2049."
0,I love Blade Runner.
0,Especially more older films
0,"Despite it's faults, I really enjoy the original Blade Runner."
0,It has a fantastic atmosphere.
0,"Yeah, they don't make movies like they used to."
0,If they had Keanu Reeves it would have been better.
0,The ain actor ruined the film.
0,Speaking of Keanu I loved Replicas.
0,"Yeah, Keanu Reeves is great!"
0,What is Replicas?
0,I don't think I know that one.
0,He is the main role it is similar to x-files and a mix of matrix.
0,Cloning.
0,i really like it and i think you would.
0,you should check it out.
0,Sounds interesting.
0,Is it a newer film?
0,2018 byt anything this guy makes is really good.
0,he is under rated in my opinion.
0,he would have been awesome in the newer version of the shining rather than ewan mcgregor.
0,Never been a fan of Ewan McGregor to be honest.
0,"Cool, so pretty recent, surprised I never heard of it."
0,Any other actors of note in Replicas?
0,me neither.
0,a bunch of unknowns which makes it better and he tends to make those types of films anyhow.
0,But John Ortiz has made some films for drama
0,"Replicas sounds great, I feel like Keanu Reeves has been everywhere recently, but I only recall seeing the him in John Wick films as of late."
0,I'd love to see the trailer for it and check it out.
0,awesome.
0,no one would ever play john wick better than him btw.
0,i wish they had him in deathwish rather than the other guy from die hard
0,"Ha, I never watched the new Deathwish."
0,I've seen some of the originals and even those were done to death by Charles Bronson.
0,Would be great to see Hollywood embrace more original ideas instead of drudging up established IP's because of their noteriety.
0,i agree.
0,everything is a remake.
0,they are even trying to remake now Hitchcock's films.
0,which we both know will ruin the films.
0,"I recently found out they already redid Psycho a few years back, I was shocked."
0,yea that was not the same.
0,back then they had great actors that didnt need technology to pull you into the film.
0,have you seen the purge?
0,"No, I haven't seen any of the Purge films."
0,"Going to check out Replicas though, thanks for the recommendation."

0,Ok awesome!

0,Do you like action dramas too?
1,I like action dramas but I have not heard of this movie.
0,What is it about?
0,It's awesome!
0,It's about this woman who goes on the hunt for revenge after her a horrible tragedy
0,It doesn't really sound like the type of movie I would be interested in.
1,Do you have any other recommendations?
0,Ok sure!
0,and just wondering.
0,What was it about frozen 2 that you really enjoyed the most?
0,My kids watched the first one when they were a little younger so we all wanted to watch the secone one as a family.
0,It was just something we did as a family.
0,It's not my typical movie.
0,Ok got it!
0,And you did say you liked action dramas.
0,What do you like most about those kinds of movies?
0,I like that they keep you on the edge of your seat and they keep your attention during the whole movie.
0,They also keep you guessing about what is going to happen next.
0,Yeah totally.
0,I'm the same way.
0,I love suspense!
0,Yes the suspense is the best part.
0,That reminds me of this movie I saw recently called Us.
0,It's a little bit of horror but it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.
0,It starts Lupita Nyong'o as the main character.
0,Me and my friends watched it together and it's definitely something you won't forget
0,I think I have heard of this movie.
0,It sounds like something I would really like to see.

0,at home or in theater
0,First Theater then home.
0,i cant think of the theater at the moment.
0,I've seen some but not so recently.
0,at home i have been watching holiday movies
0,I think you should see the movie Longshot.
0,It is a hilarious love story
1,i like comedy love stories.
0,I will see about watching this soon
0,You wont regret it.
0,It has Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron.
0,It is easily one of the best movies I have seen all yearI love that it is a comedy and a romance..
1,Any other recommendation
0,Good boys is another great comedy to see.
0,probably more cute than funny
0,Noooo Its hilarious.
0,Its not what you think.
0,I said the same thing.
0,I laughed tears the entire time.
0,"boys first kiss and the girl next door, cute and funny"
0,Its almost like Superbad but with children.
0,It really is a coming of age story about 12 year olds and what it is like growing up in todays times.
0,It is about children but it is not a child movie.
0,I'm actually laughing thinking about it.
0,You wont be dissapointed.
0,Another great movie to see right now is A beautiful day in the neighborhood- The Mr Rogers movie.
0,Its nostalgic and I feel the best move of the year.
0,Tom Hanks did an excellent job.
0,Ok interesting that it is of today children coming of age.
0,I love Tom Hanks but not so sure if I could do Mr. Rogers
0,It is a heavy movie but very good.
0,If you watched Mr Rogers growing up I suggest it.
0,"I think I'll go with Longshot, thank you for your recommendations"
0,Hello.

0,I do!
1,"I love watching movies in general and enjoy all genres, but I've noticed one of my dogs always watches the tv when a scary movie is on, haha."
0,Funny you say that because my dog does the same thing especially when I watched a comedy with dogs in it.
0,It was funny because she kept tilting her head at the tv.
0,"Hahaha, that's hilarious."
0,I think my dog just gets worried about what's happening whenever the intense music starts to play.
0,Yes the music can be very intense!
0,What scary movie did you recently watch that made your dog watch the movie as well?

0,"I am a big fan of thrillers, like Stephen king movies."
0,I would say it's more of a thriller.

0,I like those types of movies!

0,Get Out was great!
1,"I love psychological thrillers as well, probably one of my favorite genres!"
0,Yes it was so interesting to see what was going to happen next!
0,And the ending was pretty surprising!
0,It was!
0,It's great to see a movie that constantly keeps you guessing until the very end
0,Are thrillers your favorite genre?
0,I like them a lot but I love a good comedy!
1,"I would say thrillers are my favorite, but I'm not picky about genres!"
1,Comedies are great as well!
0,Have you watched any of the saw movies?
0,I  watched jigsaw but need to watch it.

0,"But as he becomes less dependent on the phone, Jexi starts to morph into a tech nightmare that's determined to keep Phil all to itself."
0,That doesn't sound like a comedy.
0,"Jexi is like QUOTATION_MARKHerQUOTATION_MARK replayed as a lightly satiric, casually foul-mouthed smart/dumb commercial comedy"
0,Well I will try to watch Jexi after I watch Zombieland 2
0,Adam Devine is the main character in the movie

1,I like Dywane Johnson.
0,But I really don't have a favorite.
0,Yeah he's pretty cool.
0,He's in a new movie coming out in a couple of months.
0,"Jungle Cruise, it looks pretty good."
0,Have you seen the trailer for it?
0,You know I don't think I have.
0,"He plays a boat captain, taking a group of explorers to find some lost tomb in south america."
0,It takes place in the early 1900s.
0,It looks like a mix of Jumanji and Pirates of the Caribbean.
0,A lot of action and adventure.
0,Does that sound like something you would like to see?
0,Yeah I would look at the trailer and see how it is.
0,I liked Jumanji so I probably would like Jungle Cruise.
0,Yeah it looks really good.
0,I will recommend that movie for you then.
0,Sound good?
0,Yes it does
0,"Hey, how are you doing today?"
1,IM doing good looking for a recommendation for a family friendly movie

1,i love animated movies
0,"I recently got the Disney+ membership and watched a bunch of movies this last month, it had such a great selection!"
0,What are some of your favorite movies on Disney+?
0,We love legos
0,My favorite one that I had not seen and was very happy to have stumbled upon was Inside Out a Pixar Film
0,I've never heard of it does it have a good storyline?
0,"Oh yes, it's a very endearing tale about the 4 main emotions that we all go through and the things that trigger those emotions and feelings."
0,Made me cry for sure!
0,I think that sounds like a great movie to watch tonight
0,I think you will love it.
0,Had me on the roller coaster of emotions but it wasn't overly sad or dramatic.
0,Just right in my opinion.:)
0,How long was the movie?
0,I want to say about an hour and 20 minutes or so
0,Does it have animals in it or is it about people?
0,"Not really animals, they are people that look like their emotions."
0,I think there are some animals when they adventure through the brain.
0,Is it adults or kids emotions?
0,"The focus is on the young girl, but adults will certainly relate if they can remember being a kid.:)"
0,that does sound like a great movie.
0,Anything else i should no about it?
0,"Have your snacks and drinks ready so you don't have to miss anything, and don't forget the tissues of you tend to cry....it might cause a few to fall!"
0,I definitely will i am 100% thats the movie ill watch
0,Awesome!
0,Have a great night watching it.
0,"There is a cool Pixar Short for it as well, you can probably find it in the extras."

0,Hi!
0,Have you seen any good movies lately?
0,Yes I have!
0,What have you seen?
0,"I just saw Sonic last weekend, it was really a cute move"
0,That's a great one that I think my kids would like.
0,Do you enjoy those kinds of movies
0,"I do, I am dying to go see the invisible man!"
0,"I am not normally a fan of scary movies, but that looks good to me"
0,That's based on Twilight Zone episode!
0,I would totally recommend it.
0,"I have never heard of Twilight Zone, but normally action or romance, and of course with kids I see mostly kids movies"
0,"Twilight Zone is an old black/white tv series, they usually play episodes around New Year."
0,I enjoy more romance movies myself
0,"Hmm, I will have to look into that,  I think Dirty Dancing is my all time favorite"
0,I love Dirty Dancing too.
0,Don't leave baby in a corner
0,Never!
0,So you think I should try Invisible Man?
0,"Sure why not, looks interesting to me too."
0,But maybe check out the Dirty Dancing remake?
0,"Maybe, I wonder if you can actually re-make a classic like that."
0,Will it be the same without Patrick??!!
0,"Probably wont be as good, the remake is never AS good."
0,But could provide some entertainment
0,"That is what movies are all about, entertainment."
0,If I am not entertained I will fall asleep.
0,I think I will try the new Dirty Dancing and see what I think.
1,I do like comparing movies against one another when they are remakes or movies made from books
0,HA me too!
0,I think the books is always better though.
0,Nothing like seeing things with your own imagination
0,"I agree, I love reading and have yet to see a movie that I liked better than the book."
0,There are a few that came close for me but I'd rather the book
0,A Dirty Dancing book would be great!
0,Yes!
0,Patrick would be the lead
0,Yes it would!
0,"Thanks for the recommendation, I am going to try the Dirty Dancing movie first!"
0,hello there!
0,I am here to help you find a movie trailer.
0,what is your favorite genre?
1,"Hey, my favorite genre is Rom Com."
0,oh that is great!
0,mine too!
0,what is the latest you have seen?
0,i recently watched The Switch.
0,Have you seen that one?
0,"No, and it doesn't sound familiar."
0,Jennifer Aniston stars in that one next to Jason Bateman.
0,Do you like them?
0,would you be interested in me telling you a little about The Switch or is there a certain Rom-Com movie you already had an idea of.
0,"Oh okay, I know the movie switch."
0,I didn't really like that one
0,Okay not a problem.
0,A more recent one that was released in 2019 with the always funny Rebel Wilson called QUOTATION_MARKIsn't it RomanticQUOTATION_MARK is like a female version of Shallow Hal starring Jack Black.
0,have you already seen those.
0,I've seen shallow hal but not this isn't it romantic.
0,What else do you know about that
0,So Rebel Wilson feels she is unworthy of love because of her weight and is super self conscious.
0,she hits her head and when she awakes she has all this new confidence and puts herself out there.
0,she realizes she is in a Rom-Com but thinks its a dream so she plays along.
0,Gets to date a very handsome man.
0,but learns more about herself at the same time.
0,does that sound like something you might be interested in seeing?
0,Yes!
0,I would love that recommendation!!!!
0,awesome while I get the link for the movie.
0,let me just add this a great date night movie so dont forget the popcorn and candy ;-)
0,Lol if my SO wasn't up north for work and liked Rom Coms
0,thats a bummer for sure!
0,this movie will for sure keep your spirit up with a great laugh
0,"Awesome, Do you have a trailer I could watch?"
0,I am searching the trailer right now there are a few with the same title.
0,I want to make sure i get you the correct one.
0,Okay Great!
0,okay thank you so much for waiting with me!
0,"No problem, I understand how computers work lol"
0,lol yes i found it!
0,again i hope you enjoy this have a wonderful day
0,You too!
0,Thanks
0,"Hello, how are you?"
0,Hi.
0,I'm doing alright.
0,It's been a relaxing weekend.
0,How about you?
0,It's quiet here.
0,Going to watch some Netflix later.
0,You see any good movies lately?
0,Nothing that really stands out right now.
0,I've had a bit too much drama lately.
0,"Thinking back, I do have to say that I enjoy a good Psychological Thriller"
0,Me too.
0,I saw El Camino recently.
0,It was great!
0,That was intense.
0,I love Breaking Bad.
0,I'm thinking something more like Silence of the Lambs or Along Came a Spider.
0,Ever see anything like that?
0,Got it.
0,"Yeah, I've seen Silence of the Lambs - it was eerie."
0,Anthony Hopkins is soooo chilling in it.
0,He's good
0,Did you see the sequel?
0,Hannibal.
0,Sure did.
0,"I think there was another one after that, but I don't think I've seen it."
0,Yes!
0,Red Dragon.
0,That was intense.
0,"I think I've seen it, but I don't remember at all."
0,Maybe it's time to rewatch the whole series.
0,What was Red Dragon about?
0,"It's about the guy that caught Hannibal the first time, Will Graham."
0,He's play by Edward Norton.
0,"Years later, Graham is investigating another serial killer and goes to Hannibal for advice."
0,"Hannibal, of course, manipulates things for his own end."
0,"Ralph Fiennes is the serial killer, who is obsessed with this painting, The Red Dragon and thinks he is possessed by that dragon."
0,I think that's a good choice.
0,I hope you enjoy it!
0,Do you think I should start back with Hannibal since I don't remember it well?
0,I don't think the order matters.
0,I'd go with Red Dragon first - I liked it more than Hannibal.
0,While we're at it.
0,Have you seen any good comedies lately?
0,I have a feeling I'll need something to lighten up my mood afterwards :)
0,"Spider Man Into the Spider Verse was good - it was funny and exciting, and the animation was incredible."
0,I've heard good things about that one.
0,I think I'll start with Red Dragon and then check that out as well.
0,"Hi there, I'm Janette"
0,Hi I'm Laura
0,"Have you seen Bohemian Rhapsody, the movie?"
0,"No I have not, I am not familiar with that movie."
0,"No worries, what was the last movie you saw?"
0,"I watched that movie with Adam Sandler, Uncut Gems."
0,I thought it was going to be funny but it wan't funny at all.
0,It seems like a serious movie.
0,You seem like you like funny movies.
0,What's the funniest movie you've seen?
1,I think my all time favorite is Step Brothers
0,Yes!
0,That movie is hilarious!
0,I have seen it about 10 times
0,I probably have seen it 20 or 30 times!
0,I think I like the first part better than the part when they start doing the Boats and **** song but I will say that has got to be one of my top 5 movies EVER
0,Got It
0,Are we done talking now??
0,I wouldn't mind watching that again now!!:)
0,Would you like to watch this movie trailer?
0,Yes I would
0,Want to watch the trailer for Get Hard?
0,It is a comedy with Will Ferrell
0,Yes I think I have seen that one too.
0,Funny
0,Did you see it in theaters?
0,No I saw it at home.
0,I have the DVD
0,"Oh ok, I saw it in theaters."
0,It had 2 nominations!
0,One of my top movies as well..
0,A friend of mine was actually in the movie.
0,I accept your recommendation.
0,I believe you accepted my as well.
0,Nice speaking with you.
0,It was nice speaking with you too!
0,"Yes, you will have a good laugh."
0,Hello
0,Hello!
0,"Nice to meet you, I really like movies, all sorts of them in fact!"
0,How about you?
0,"Yes, I love movies."
0,I am a fan of Victorian style movies.
0,I am here to assist you with looking for a movie trailer.
0,What is your favorite movie style?
1,"To be honest that's a hard question to answer, I like all sorts of movies."
0,"I am unfamiliar with the Victorian style, can you explain what that is a bit perhaps?"
1,"I know I enjoy many action, thrillers, horror, comedy, drama, and suspense types."
0,I am quite curious about maybe seeing a trailer for a favorite movie of yours in the victorian style as that would be new to me.
0,Most of the victorian style movies have been developed from a writer of that era and have been made more than once.
0,They tend to remake them between 10 and 20 years apart.
0,The newest one to fall under this category would be EMMA.
0,Gwyneth Paltrow played Emma in the last one.
0,They are of English/England culture in nature between early and late 1800s.
0,"Oh I see, that sounds quite interesting I will search a trailer for that!"
0,Thank you for the suggestion.
0,My pleasure.
0,Oscar Wilde is a great writer of that era.
0,Jane Eyre and The Little Women are also of that nature.
0,Social issues and proper etiquette rule the show.
0,"The humor can be found in the expectation of proper etiquette yet, the rude manner it can be delivered."
0,A great place to learn proper ways of socializing.
0,"I just watched a small trailer for the movie EMMA that you suggested, I can indeed see many of the elements you mentioned being in the movie."
0,"It looks like it would be a wonderful watch with a close friend of mine, i think we will put this on our to do list!"
0,I know we both would quite enjoy the humor in this show just from the brief trailer I saw.
0,Great!
0,Another movie is An Ideal Husband.
0,This was a play written by Oscar Wilde turned into a movie.
0,"He is also the author of the play, QUOTATION_MARKThe Importance of Being"
0,"Oh, I have not heard of either of those either."
0,I will do some researching on An Ideal Husband as well.Being from the same writer I am certain I would be interested in seeing more of their work.
0,The Importance of Being Earnest is the play I mentioned.
0,This play can be watched on YOUTUBE.
0,You will find it interesting as a form of a movie/play.
0,"I just watched a trailer for QUOTATION_MARKAn Ideal HusbandQUOTATION_MARK this looks like another good suggestion, also QUOTATION_MARKThe importance of being ErnestQUOTATION_MARK sounds very familiar, I know I have heard of that before, thank you for that suggestion too."
0,You are welcome
0,"An Ideal Husband is from 1999, and has many familiar faces of actors I have seen in other films over the years."
0,"I am shocked I don't recall watching it, but it also seems a good watch with my friend I mentioned previously."
0,"I tend to do movie nights often with a close friend, and we are always looking for new things to watch, I know she would like these."
0,Yes...I agree.
0,The play on our social scenes versus early England society is wonderful.
0,We are still the same except they hid their misdoings while we are more relaxed about shortcomings.
0,"I agree with you, it's nice to be able to find comedy in such things, nothing better than enjoying a nice laugh and a good story."
0,Especially with loved ones!
0,"If you are ever curious what became of Oscar Wilde there is a 2018 movie, QUOTATION_MARKTHE HAPPY PRINCEQUOTATION_MARK that explains what became of him."
0,"Subsequently, explaining why we haven't heard from him after a certain period of time."
0,"That sounds quite interesting too, I will do some research on that now."
0,"That was another movie type I forgot to mention liking, autobiography I guess it would be called?"
0,telling the story of someones life works and such
0,Yes...Oscar Wilde is an interesting character to learn about.
0,Don't forget to have tea and pastries for your movie night.
0,A good idea with a Victorian themed movie date.
0,HAVE A WONDERFUL NIGHT....good night
0,"Thank you again for the wonderful suggestions, I researched QUOTATION_MARKThe Happy PrinceQUOTATION_MARK and will definitely look into watching that as well, and what a wonderful idea setting up some tea and pastries for movie night snacks, bravo!"
0,"I accept your recommendations, you have a goodnight too."

0,yeah I'd say comedy action or sci-fi.
0,I can't wait for the new season of Big Mouth
0,"heard of that but never watched it, what kinda show is it?"
0,basically like a raunchy cartoon where the characters are all middle school students experiencing puberty but ridden in a way that it's geared toward adults to be able to look back nostalgically.
0,I do not like animations or cartoons.
0,what other movie or show is really good?
0,As far as a movie I really like QUOTATION_MARKWhy HimQUOTATION_MARK with James Franco and Bryan Cranston

0,"a lot of people have been talking about shameless, i guess watch that"
0,yeah it's a bit of a roller coaster.
0,you start off rooting for some characters and by the end of a season you do a complete 180

1,Movies that have awards or have higher ratings are always give more of an incentive to watch.
0,"I agree, it is also more interesting if it is based on a true story."
0,Shows the struggles that this generation could never image.
0,That is why I love that genre as well!
0,To see and watch something that has actually happened that at the same time seems so unreal!
0,Mind blowing!
0,"Yes, the base of the movie is about two British privates that were given an impossible mission to deliver a message deep in enemy territory, these days they would just use phone or email."
0,So interesting.
0,Have you or are you planning on watching this movie?
0,I don't have plans set in stone but I would like to watch it before it is no longer available in theater.
0,I think war movies are best watched on a big screen with surround sound.
0,"Yes, agreed."
0,Adds that extra flare for sure.
0,Ig to invest in a sound bar for this very reason.
0,I used to have one and they are great for movie watching!
0,"That's not a bad idea, a sound bar would be a great addition to a home theater system!"

0,The most recent one I watched was QUOTATION_MARKThe Invisible ManQUOTATION_MARK
0,Did you really enjoy the invisible Man?
0,If so what was it that seemed to have you intrigued?
0,It was really good!
0,The story line wasn't your traditional horror flick.
0,It was sort of predictable but it still had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
0,"The story flowed really well and it didn't have a lot of dull moments, which often happens in horror movies."
0,"Do u prefer horror movies that have a realistic plot, fictional plot, or doesn't matter?"
0,"It doesn't really matter, I feel like it's always scarier though if it's based on a true story."
0,I couldn't agree more.
0,"Do you enjoy horror movies, as well?"
0,"I enjoy the true stories, I have my degree in criminal Justice so I enjoy learning about the cases and psychological aspect."
0,"As for horror in general, I'm more of a comedy person."
0,Okay that's so interesting.
0,"What is your favorite movie, in that genre?"
0,That is a hard one.
0,"As a kid, hands down any Rush hour."
0,"But, now there are so many good ones."
0,"I just don't care to much for the remakes..  like American pie was cool, not the 2,4, or 6th one"
0,"That's true, the remakes are usually never as good as the originals!"
0,I'm finding it difficult to decide on which one to recommend.
0,I've narrowed it down to two
0,"Okay, go for it!"
0,"Well the first, Maggie, isn't based on a true story (as previously discussed) but given our current events with the coronavirus, who's to say it couldn't happen?"
0,Lol.
0,It stars some phenomenal and well known actors as well.
0,This was a great recommendation!
0,The plot goes really well with the current sitations!
0,"However, I am leaning towards the movie trailer for split."
0,It has 8 awards and 19 nominations.
0,The story line is sure to keep you in the edge of your seat.
0,That is actually one of my favorites!
0,Such an amazing story and plot twist at the end!
0,I've personally never seen the entire movie.
0,"However, I read this book called Sybil many times I loved it so much and the plot to split reminded me so much of the book."
0,Sybil was based off a true story with multi personalities.
0,Hi!
0,I'm here this morning to help you look for a movie trailer.
0,Hello I see the movie trailer
0,What kinds of movie trailers might you be interested in seeing?
0,Do you like action movies
0,"I do, but I'm a big fan of horror movies."
0,How about you?
0,I see a horror movie trailer
0,What was the last horror movie or horror movie trailer that you watched?
0,Last horror movie let me think for a sec I have a few horror movies stuck in my mind
0,Horror movies are so much fun to watch.
0,"When you can remember which ones you watched, do you mind telling me what you liked or didn't like about the movie?"
0,"The Conjuring, Annabelle"
0,"Annabelle, yes."
0,I loved that movie!

0,Candyman is a movie about a black man who was murdered for being in love with a white woman.
0,He is summoned to reality by a skeptic college graduate student who was infatuated with his story.
0,Thati with director Nia DeCosta
0,"There is a sequel coming out in June, yes."
0,"As I'm a big fan of the original 1992 movie, I think you would love it."
0,I have to go see that one it looks interesting I took a peek at from my iPhone on imb.com reviews
0,The one coming out in June?
0,"Yes, it looks to be quite promising."
0,The 1992 film was absolutely amazing.
0,"I was re-watching the movie for the one millionth time last year and during my re-watch, when Candyman was being summoned, the power went out in my house."
0,Talk about jump scare!
0,I thought he was coming to my home.
0,":D I think anyone who hasn't seen this movie, should definitely give it a try."
0,"It's got a great story, great actors and is plenty creepy."
0,"Watch out for the Candyman huh, I get into horror movies I might look up the 1992 and play it out and see if I can get down tot he movie theater in June when that one comes out."
0,"Oh, definitely!"
0,"Tony Todd, the actor who plays Candyman in the 1992 film and the upcoming one is the perfect actor for this character."
0,He has this deep voice that will send chills down your spine when you hear him speak.
0,I absolutely love it.
0,Can't get enough of it.
0,Is he the character Anthony McCoy being played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II in 2020?
0,"Somewhat, yes."
0,Anthony McCoy is going to be a hallucinatory reflection of the Candyman.
0,We will still hear Tony Todd's voice I believe and may even see him a few times in the 2020 film.
0,Quite interesting.
0,"I have high hopes for the remake that's coming out later this year, but since we may not see Tony Todd much in the movie, I strongly recommend for you to see 1992 film."
0,Ok do you know if itscription streaming
0,"It is, yes!"

0,"I really loved the first one and while the second one wasn't *as good*, I still really enjoyed it!"
0,Especially the midcredit scene :P
0,I hate when that happens it seems like the sequel is always less exciting than the first.
0,"I think if Zombieland: Double Tap came out first, though, It would be the favorite... Like if the movies were to flip dates our opinions would be different."
0,It sounds like they would be if they were.
0,I'm going to attempt to send the movie trailer again.
0,Okay cool.
0,I try not to have high hopes with sequels just as I try to separate books from their movies and pretend they are both their own thing.
0,They definitely leave a lot out in the movies compared to some books.
0,Any luck with the link?
0,"I can't get birds of prey, I can get warm bodies, ouija, and the duff"

0,And funny.
1,I like his comedic talent.
0,I reccomend Guardians of the Galaxy 2
0,Actually I've seen that movie.
0,But it's been awhile.
0,That would make a good one for tonight.
0,I know what to expect.
0,I like it and will watch later.
0,Thanks.
0,Since you have already seen that.
0,I would try and watch one more current.
0,not action but a different genre
0,No thanks.

0,It's a fun movie and I want fun tonight.
0,Thanks.

0,The first was great.
0,If you like movie like QUOTATION_MARKA Quiet PlaceQUOTATION_MARK then I can definitely make some recommendations.
0,Yes please!
0,I would like that.
0,What did you like about A Quiet Place?

0,OKay let's find some trailers similar to that.
0,Please find some suitable trailers for me.
0,Have you seen 10 Cloverfield Lane?
0,Yes I have!
0,And loved that movie.
0,"That would be my top pick, but since you've seen it... how about QUOTATION_MARKAnnihilationQUOTATION_MARK?"
0,with Natalie Portman?
0,"I have not seen QUOTATION_MARKAnnihilationQUOTATION_MARK!, would you recommend this movie?"
0,I would.
0,It's similar to A Quiet Place but different enough to be interesting so you dont feel like youre watching the same movie again.
0,It's less focused on the QUOTATION_MARKquietQUOTATION_MARK elements but features a good bit of mysterious fantasy creatures and a general sci-fi mystery plot
0,I do accept this recommendation and can not wait to see.
0,Thank you very much!
0,You'll like it.
0,But if I may make another suggestion.
0,Don't Breathe is also great within this genre.
0,"This title would be more of a suspenseful, quiet, with lots of scares and a less involved plot."
0,I can view the first recommendation and look into this other QUOTATION_MARKDon't BreatheQUOTATION_MARK as the next movie to watch.
0,Thank you so much!
0,You're welcome.
0,Good luck!

0,I would like to help you with any movie trailer recommendations!
0,awesome.
0,any ideas
0,I have a few.
0,What type of movies have you watched in the last couple months?
0,"jojo rabbit, knives out, shadow"
0,I would first recommend Gemini Man with Will Smith.
0,Awesome movie with plenty of action but also some plot twists that lead to an interesting plot.
0,I have not seen that movie yet.
0,I've thought of watching it maybe
0,It highly recommend it.
0,Smith rarely disappoints.
0,Another one would be Once Upon a Time in Hollywood if you like Tarantino movies or Ford vs Ferrari for a combination historical/suspense movie.
0,I will definitely watch it soon then.
0,Tarantino's movies are the best
0,Excellent.
0,Enjoy!
0,Good chatting with you.
0,good bye
0,I have sent a couple of those movie trailers to you for you to view
0,I will try to view them.
0,buy trailers sometimes giveaway the plot
0,They occasionally do.
0,From what I remember about the Gemini Man trailer is that it only gives away plot points that are already evident on the movie cover.
0,There are enough other twists hidden in the movie.
0,my favorite movie of will smith is Men in black.
0,but he also does serious movies also.
0,This will in line with his normal level of acting.
0,Throwing in suttle humor while not losing the mood of the scene.
0,I'm just glad he is still in movies
0,I agree.
0,It's fun to see long time actors also evolve into other roles.
0,Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of BelAir to his movie roles now are night and day but it is still authentically him.
0,I forgot Gemini Man was himself against himself from the trailer.
0,after rewatching it
0,"Yep, pretty interesting premise."
0,"sort of like predestination, but not time travel i assume"
0,No time travel.
0,It has more of a realistic vibe.
0,Hope you enjoy it!

1,Do you have any recommendations??
0,"Oh yeah, if you like comedies have you seen 21 jump street?"
0,"And for thrillers, ever heard of QUOTATION_MARKThe devilQUOTATION_MARK"
0,I have seen 21 Jump Street.
0,It was really funny and I love ice cubes character in the movie.
0,I have never heard of the devil.
0,Do you have any details about the movie?
0,So the movie is about a group of people where they all have a secret past.

0,That is exactly the type of movie I usually go for.
0,I am definitely going to check that out.
0,Awesome.
0,I think youll like it because I saw it on Netflix.
0,"RARELY is anything thriller or scary decent on netflix, so i always recommend it"
0,That is awesome that it is on Netflix.
0,The only decent thrillers on Netflix I have seen are foreign shows or movies with subtitles and sometimes they are hard to get through.
0,Yes I agree!
0,I am sure you have heard of the Zodiac.
0,"The movie is on Netflix as well, and that one is also a solid piece."
0,Yes I have seen the Zodiac.
0,That is another good one!

0,I have never been disappointed though with anything from him.
0,You will like it for sure if you have a chance to check it out.
0,I will for sure.
0,Thank you for a rec as well!
0,Hello!
0,Can I help you find a movie?
0,Please!
1,"I'm a huge fan of horror films, but prefer more dread than gore."
1,Do you have any suggestions?
0,What is your favorite horror film?
0,My favorite horror film would probably be The Shining.
0,It's a unique story that keeps the viewer on edge the entire time.
1,I love that over jump scares and senseless gore.
0,"Ok, awesome."
0,Are you looking for something like an older classic or maybe something newer?
1,Preferably something modern as I've seen most of the classic horror films numerous times already.
0,It's hard to beat the classics.
0,I love the suspense in Hitchcock movies the best.
0,Agreed!
0,"He was truly a master of suspense that only a select few have come close to replicating  (Shyamalan, Kubrick, Flanagan, etc.)."
0,You know of any newer films that could pass as QUOTATION_MARKHitchcock-ianQUOTATION_MARK?
0,I will do my best to find something you haven't seen!
0,Thank you!
0,"If it helps, something that deals more with dread than anything else."
0,Nothing tops feeling dread throughout an entire film!
0,How did you feel about Split from M. Night?
0,"Did you find it too slow, or did that have the dread you're looking for?"
0,I actually haven't seen that one yet.
0,I also did not know Night made that one.
0,Can you tell me a little bit of what it's about?
0,It's one of my favorites he's done so far.
0,James McAvoy does an mind blowingly good job at playing I think 23 different personalities in the film.
0,23 personalities!
0,That sounds interesting.
0,"Without giving too much away, is he like a villain in the film?"
0,He's truly a talented actor but I've never seen him play a QUOTATION_MARKbad guyQUOTATION_MARK before.
0,He's *mostly* the bad guy.
0,The film is about a group of girls that are abducted and held hostage by a person with multiple personalities.
0,One personality in particular - The Beast - has a plan for them.
0,"Some of the personalities side with The Beast, and some do not."
0,"It is the second film in the Unbreakable series, but different in style for sure."
0,"You don't need to know anything about Unbreakable to see Split, though."
0,Wow!
0,That sounds like a psychological mind twist and definitely vintage Shyamalan.
0,I will accept the recommendation and give it a watch!
0,It sounds like it's right up my alley and deals more with dread and suspense.
0,Thank you kindly!
0,You're welcome!
0,Can you tell me the rating and why it received the rating?
0,"It has a 7.3 on IMDB, with 19 nominations and 8 awards."
0,Would you like to watch the trailer?
0,I would love to see the trailer!
0,And that rating is perfect for me as trolls like to give great movies bad ratings so anything above a 6 must truly be great!
