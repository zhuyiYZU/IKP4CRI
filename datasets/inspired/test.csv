0,Hi There!
0,What types of movies do you like to watch?
0,Hello!
1,I'm more of an action movie or a good romance and mystery movie.
0,I just saw the trailer for Knives Out when I went to see Joker and it looked like a good mix of action and mystery!
0,I seen that one too as I seen Joker about a month ago.
0,I thought about asking my fiance about going and seeing it.
0,It looks like a good movie for people who like many different movies.
0,It also has a great cast!
0,I was surprised to see Chris Evans in the trailer!
0,Maybe with Chris Evans in it it'll be easier to convince my fiance to see it.
0,Do you know who else is in the cast?
0,Daniel Craig and Jamie Lee Curtis are also in the cast.
0,Daniel Craig does a lot of 007 so definitely a good hearthrob role to convince the misses lol!
0,I am the misses lol.
0,But he loves the bond movies so that should be a good incentive for him to go see it.
1,Do you have any other recommendations?
0,"The new Star Wars comes out in less than a month, if you are into the franchise."
0,"He is, I think he told me we're getting it when it comes out to add to our movie collection."
0,Well that is another great action movie.
0,I also recommend the John Wick series
0,I haven't seen any of that series.
0,Could you tell me what the general plot is>
0,"John Wick is a former member of a gang, he was basically an assassin."
0,"He falls in love and quits the game, but then his wife dies, and someone comes in and kills his dog."
0,He then goes on a revenge rampage against the people who broke into his house.
0,I have yet to watch the 3rd one but the action scenes were really cool!
0,Oh I'd definitely would cry at the dogs death.
0,It is really sad!
0,the dog was a last gift from his dying wife which makes it so much worse
0,I couldn't even finish I am legend because of the dog dying.
0,Anything with animal death makes me ball like a baby.
0,Marley & Me had me crying for a good half hour so I completely understand that!
0,I avoided that movie because someone told me he passed away.
0,My fiance took me to see jurrasic world as our first date and I cried at the dinosuars dying.
0,I would definitely avoid that movie if animal deaths make you said.
0,Oh that is so cute though!
0,"Yeah, he had to calm me down for about an hour and bought me ice cream to apologize for it."
0,Aww that is so sweet.
0,"Given that you dont want to see animals die, and you are looking for an Action/Mystery I think Knives Out would be a good movie choice."
0,Do you agree?
0,I do agree with that.
0,When it comes out i'll bring it up for date night.
0,Thank you!!

0,"Ooph I like Will Smith a lot too, not always the best guy for serious roles though, is it better than his last few serious movies?"
0,"I think he has come a long way in this one, it is definitely worth watching"
0,"If it's like Enemy of the State or I Am Legend I'll probably give it a watch, if it's like Hancock or that one After Earth I'll probably pass"

0,I believe its called It's a beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.
0,Hello how are you?
1,"I am looking for something to watch, preferably action, comedy, or thriller if it is not too scary."
0,Horror films always scare me too.
0,What kind of action and comedy movies do you like?
0,Are you into action movies with explosions or adventure?
0,And are you into rom/com's or more traditional comedy?
1,"My Best Friends Wedding, Green Book, Die Hard, Shawshank Redemption"
0,Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies!
0,Have you ever seen any of the Fast and Furios movies?
0,They have a spin-off that came out this year called Hobbs and Shaw.
0,"Also, there is a new John Wick if you're looking for action movies similar to Die Hard."
0,I have seen The Rock discussing it on some talk show a few weeks back.
0,I don't know the franchise enough to know the storyline but I loved the fast and the furious.
0,The spin-off is pretty loosely based off of the main movies so you could watch it and still be able to follow since it's mostly about fast cars and general action movie elements.
0,What kind of comedy movies do you like besides My Best Friends Wedding?
0,"Are you into satire, anything animated?"
1,I usually don't do traditional comedy but I have to say I LOVED  Old School.!
0,Will Ferrell is one of my favorites.
0,Old School was so funny!
0,Will Ferrell is hilarious have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2?
0,My niece was JUST talking about that yesterday.
0,She showed me a clip real quick and I am definitely going to check it out.
0,"Great choice, any other suggestions?"
0,"Hmm as far as thriller, have you seen Bird Box?"
0,That one seemed to have a lot of hype.
0,It was not too scary but had a good amount of jump scares without the gore
0,I think I have heard of it but don't know the story.
0,Based on what you said that would be a no.
0,I am thinking more Mission Impossible or Money Train.
0,"Well speaking of Mission Impossible, there is a new one that recently came out last year and Jack Reacher is also a good alternative also starring Tom Cruise"
0,That sounds cool.
0,What is that about?
0,It's about an army vet that investigates the mass killing of 5 random people in the same town by a sniper who has a weird history with him.
0,It's one of those action movies where there are a lot of plot twists
0,Definitely sounds cool.
0,I will definitely take a look
0,Sounds great!
0,You've got two great movies to check out is there any other movie genre you want recommendations on?

0,What is that new movie coming out of hers?
0,The one where she is a stripper?
0,I just watched that yesterday!
0,Hustlers its a really good movie I would recommend it.
0,I agree they dont give her enough credit

0,It is a really interesting movie and Joaquin Phoenix rendition of the Joker is very captivating.
0,"That's what I heard, I really enjoyed Heath Ledger's performance of the joker before is Joaquin's performance comparable?"
0,I think what makes both of them so good is that they are shown with very different characteristics and do it very well.

0,"That sounds very interesting and I like movies based on true stories, especially with a great actor like Robert De Niro."
0,"Yes this was just released on Netflix just last week but it is a long move, 3.5 hours long."
0,In both these movies I do predict that they will be well represented during award season.
0,"Oh, that's good it's on Netflix, I'll have to look for that."

1,Both are favorites of mine!

0,"It's about an alien, a girl, and her cat, and their adventure to rescue her mom."
0,It's hilarious.
0,Is that something that might interest you?
0,Maybe.
0,I like animated ones like Angry Birds.
0,Angry Birds was pretty funny.
0,What about Ice Age?
0,I think it has a similar type of humor.
0,"It does, I've already seen it, Skritch steals the show!"
0,I agree!

0,I can't wait to see it.
0,Me either.
0,I haven't gotten a chance yet.
0,Do you know if it will come to Netflix?
0,"Hey, what's up my friend?"
1,Hi I am looking for a movie recommendation
0,"Well, you've come to the right person."
0,"When you have a GF, you tend to see a lot of movies."
0,I am married and have two kids ages 2 and 4 so of course I was wondering what would be suitable out there for them
0,Do you have a particular genre in mind?
1,"Horror, comedy, etc..."
0,It would be a like atleast 1.5-2 hour max and a kids movie rated g
0,"Well, the obvious choice is QUOTATION_MARKA Beautiful Day in the NeighborhoodQUOTATION_MARK."
0,It's about Mr. Rogers.
0,Do we know how long that movie is
0,"Its an hour and a half, so it should hit your sweet spot."
0,That would be good.
0,Do you have any ideas on what other movies are around that amount of time and are animated?
0,For animation there is Playmobil: The Movie
0,Oh nice.
0,What is that one about?
0,"It abourt the building toy, Playmobil."
0,Its made for kids so its only an hour and a half too.
0,That is a good recommendation.
0,You know how kids are my concern was making sure they were interested in the movie because it can be hard to sit through one
0,You can't go wrong with either one.
0,"I would probably recommend the first one, but that's from an adult perspective."
0,"Unless the kids are into Mr Rogers, Playumobil should hit the spot for them best."
0,I remember Mr rogers when I was a kid it would be nice to share that with my kids
0,"Yeah, me too."
0,He was a very interesting guy.
0,Seeing the film might make the kids get into him.
0,That is true.
0,I think Tom hanks will do a good job in that one
0,Yeah.
0,"If you like Hanks and want something for the kids thats not too long, then this is the one."

0,"Enemy of the state has technology iin it to, watch that"
0,sure i will
0,"Hi, I am here to help you look for movie trailer!"
0,hello!
0,I'm going to start broadly--what kind of movies you like?
1,"I usually like documentary films, or at least historically accurate drama films!"
0,"Interesting, not very many people that I know like those sort of films, but I do."
0,"That's great, I love documentaries!"
0,It's fun to learn and be entertained at the same time.
0,What's your favorite?
0,"Well, even though I'm young in age, I do think older documentaries are still the best that has been done."
0,"Even though I would not classify this documentary as fun in a joyful manner, it is informative about a serious topic, the  Holocuast."
0,The documentary is called Shoah.
0,That sounds very difficult to watch but interesting.
0,"Is it about a specific person who lived through the Holocaust, or a more general documentary?"
0,A general documentary about how the whole process of genocide against European Jews was carried.
0,The unique thing about it is that it does not rely on a single piece of film from the 1930s or 1940s.
0,"The director, a French man travels to different parts of Europe, including the sites where the concentration camps once stood, and interviews the QUOTATION_MARKbystandersQUOTATION_MARK that saw their neighbors being removed."
0,He also includes the input of prominent historians.
0,That sounds really interesting!
0,"One would have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it I imagine, but the interviews sound fascinating and disturbing."
0,"Thanks for the info, I accept your recommendation!"
0,"Although I forgot to mention a very important fact about the documentary that deters people from watching, It has to be seen on different sittings because it runs close to 9.5 hours, which I think reflects the seriousness of the subject is addressing."
0,"That doesn't sound bad, I just watched the Ken Burns PBS documentary, which is 10+ hours I believe."
0,I really enjoyed it.
0,Have you watched any of his documentaries?
0,"No, not really and the reason being that I read what some historians had to say about his Civil War documentary and it did not sound encouraging for my taste."
0,That's too bad.
0,I really enjoyed his Vietnam documentary because he did a good job of interviewing all sides and not just Americans.
0,But his Civil War documentary was more focused on telling interesting anecdotes than the history it seemed like.
0,"Well, I think my fits perfectly your movie preferences."
0,"It is subtitled, obviously, but as a film buff I do check lists that come out in which critics rank their favorite movies and Shoah consistently ranks as one of the best, if not the best, documentary of all time."
0,"I'm not much of a film buff, but always happy to check out some films from before my time that I may have overlooked!"
0,"Another good one that the critics also seem to like is QUOTATION_MARKHoop Dreams,QUOTATION_MARK have you seen that?"
0,"Unfortunately no, I had not even heard of it."
0,"As you mentioned liking historically accurate, I do enjoy those as well."
0,"Although they might not be presented from the viewpoint of an important figure, they usually revolve around a important event like The Biggest Short with Ryan Gosling, Steve Carrell and Christian Bale."
0,It presents a point of view about what led to the 2008 economic crash.
0,I did enjoy the Biggest Short.
0,I enjoy Revolutionary War ere history but haven't found any great documentaries on that yet.
0,John Adams miniseries on HBO was pretty good for a drama though.
0,How about earlier movies about earlier periods like the 1500s?
0,I'm not very familiar with that time period unfortunately.
0,I know a little bit about some of the explorers but that's about it.
0,Any recommendations?
0,"Well, this is a movie not a documentary."
0,But I consider it one of my favorite movies of all time.
0,"It's called QUOTATION_MARKAguirre, The Wrath of GodQUOTATION_MARK It came out in 1972 and the reason why I like is because, even though it's not based on a specific, single reliable event, it's based on the idea among some Spanish conquistadores that there was hidden city made of gold (El Dorado) in the Amazon."
0,I really appreciate the German director attempt to recreate that period.
0,"Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer"
0,"hi, I love to watch movies."
0,Me too!
0,Do you have a favorite genre?
1,"family, action, and horror"

1,blood and gore

0,yes like the halloween that was directed by him.

0,Hi!
0,Is there a particular genre of movie you're interested in?
1,I normally love comedies.
0,Hmm....well lets try to narrow that down a bit.
0,There are all kinds of different comedies and some people prefer a certain kind.
0,"I, for one, am a fan of stand up."
0,"But you've got Farce, Dark Comedy, Romantic Comedy, Action Comedy and such types of Parodies."
0,Which one would you be more open to seeing?
0,"I like stand up comedy as well, but I prefer it to not have a lot of profanity or explicit content."
0,I love action comedies and romantic comedies.
0,Same stipulations though.
0,Thats good!
0,So we know you don't want anything too dirty and raunchy.
0,What type of stipulations do you have pertaining to action and romantic comedies?
0,That's pretty much it.
0,I also like movies based around World War II.
0,Though I know those genres typically do not overlap necessarily.
1,Do you have any recommendations for those genres?
0,I might have a title or two.
0,"You were right about those two genre's not exactly blending well or very often, but rest assured it does happen!"
0,How do you feel about Bette Midler and James Caan?
0,I had to google James Caan.
0,Ha!
0,I like both of them a lot.
0,I have yet to see a movie featuring Bette Midler that I did not enjoy.
0,Ha!
0,You can never go wrong with Ms. Midler.
0,I think The First Wives Club is one of my all time favorites.
0,Midler and Hawn make an excellent team!
0,I have yet to watch that movie.
0,"I remember seeing the trailer for it all the time when I watched an old VHS of A Very Brady Sequel, but I have yet to actually see it."
0,Well I think I may have the perfect movie for you.
0,"There are strong comedic elements, its set during World War 2 and starring....Bette Midler!"
0,That does sound pretty perfect!
0,I thought so!
0,Its one of my favorites.
0,Something I watch when I'm feeling nostalgic as it was released in 1991.
0,"Bette Midler and James Caan make an excellent team and of course, since it is set during WWII, you'll want to have some tissues handy."
0,I appreciate that warning.
0,I am definitely a crier!
0,Haha!
0,"Oh, there's nothing wrong with having a good cry every now and then!"
0,It's good for the soul.
0,Its a painless way to release pent up emotions.
0,At least that's what I tell myself.
0,I would think you right since I tell myself the same thing and I'm a Social Work major in college.;)
0,Oh my.
0,So you already HAD the tissues on hand!
0,"Well it's a good thing then cause I know for a fact this movie has squeezed some tears out of me, no matter how great of a mood I was in when I started watching it."
0,Well the anticipation is killing me!
0,Ha!
0,So what is the movie?
0,"The movie is called 'For the Boys', and I really do think you'll like it, if not love it."
0,Its moving and touching in all the right ways!
0,Well that sounds like a dream.
0,Can you tell me a little about the plot?
0,I like to have at least a little information to mentally and emotionally prepare myself.
0,Of course!
0,"I suppose using today's standards, it would be considered a dramedy (drama comedy) and is traces the life of Midler's character who teamed up with Caan's character, Eddie Sparks, who was a famous entertainer."
0,"He thinks he needs something to help bolster his act so he enlists the help of Dixie Leonard, Midler's character."
0,They primarily get together to train US Troops during the war.
0,Wait a minute.
0,They're entertainers but they train the military?
0,Oh gosh.
0,"I'm sorry, not train, entertain....my goodness."
0,Please forgive my mind!
0,HAHA!
0,It's totally okay.
0,I was like QUOTATION_MARKWhat qualifies showman to train the military?!QUOTATION_MARK
0,Haha!
0,So Bette Midler has some singing in it?
0,Yes!
0,"I know its not a popular stance, but I adore her voice."
0,Its so soulful!
0,I love it too!
0,That's definitely a selling point for me!
0,This movie sounds absolutely perfect.
0,I can't believe I've never heard of it.
0,I will definitely have to check it out!
0,Well hopefully the trailer sells you completely.
0,Though I'm sure you'll love it!
0,Should I watch the trailer first?
0,I always encourage people to watch trailers because there can always be that one thing that they can see in the trailer that can make them excited to see it or hesitant.
0,"Either way, I'd rather walk into something with somewhat of an idea of what I'm walking into."
0,You're right!
0,"Should I watch now or watch it before we end this chat, just in case...?"
0,Watch it at your leisure!
0,"If you have the opportunity to see it when the chat ends, go for it!"
0,Sounds great.
0,I will definitely go check it out.
0,Thank you so much for your help!
0,What kind of movies do you like?
0,I really enjoy watching thrillers and intellectually engaging movies
0,Like horror thrillers or more just suspense?
1,I really like suspense thrillers that have some historical reference like The DaVinci Code
0,Interesting.
0,Do you have a favorite actor/actress?
0,I like Tom Hanks a lot
0,What would be your favorite movie of his?
0,Definitely The DaVinci Code
0,Have you ever seen Captain Phillips?
0,"No, I haven't - was it good?"
0,I think it is a great movie and would highly recommend.
0,It has Tom Hanks and is a Biological Thriller
0,I think I will go see it tomorrow after work.
0,Thanks!
0,Perfect!
0,That would be my recommendation then
0,Thanks so much.
0,I always like a good thriller
0,"Then you should enjoy this, it will keep you on your toes"
0,Are there historical references?
0,Yeah its based on a true story of Somali pirates taking over a cargo ship
0,I've heard about that one - should be interesting.I think I can find it on Netflix
0,"I hope you can, or maybe amazon"
0,"I have both, so I can look now."
0,Thanks
0,Hi I am here to help you look for a movie trailer!
0,what type of trailers do you like to watch?
0,I like comedies.
1,Something that's well written and clever.
0,I like comedies also.
0,Who is your favorite comedian?
0,"I like comedians too, but I don't think of comedy movies and comedians in the same category exactly."
1,"Again, I like clever comedy much more so than just comedy that relies on shock value."
0,when you say clever comedies are you referencing to ones like to the tonight show?
0,I mean clever as in well written dialog vs. something that relies on slapstick.
0,So more When Harry Met Sally and less Dumb and Dumber.
0,Yes I like those also!
0,Have you seen the dialog commercial with skittles and she kisses him and he becomes infected with skittles also.
0,I that one was really clever.
0,"Yes, I do think I remember that commercial."
0,I saw Dumb and Dumber but was there a part 2?
0,I don't think that I have seen it!
0,"Yeah, I never had any desire to watch part 2."
0,"I like Jeff Daniels a lot, but that's just not my type of comedy."
0,I you have not seen Coming to America with Eddie Murphy I would like to suggest that movie for you to watch!
0,It has a nice comedy content.
0,I saw it a long time ago.
0,Definitely leans more toward the goofy vs clever dialog though.
0,So not really a good fit for me.
0,I often think about a classic movie Weird Science.
0,What do you think of that one?
0,Still in the style of goofy vs clever.
0,I'm not a fan of those types of movies.
0,Maybe something with Sandra Bullock?
0,Yes I like Sandra Bullock especially the Movie Rush and there is a recent one she just  stared in.
0,Do you mean Speed?
0,"I know she does other things too, but IQUOTATION_MARKm looking for a comedy."
0,Yes I meant Speed It has been along time since have seen that movie but Bird Box  and Miss Congeniality was also some of my favorites.
0,Miss Congenialtiy sounds good.
0,It's definitely one that I'd like to see again.
0,"It's a little bit slap-stick, but also clever dialog."
0,I would accept that recommendation.
0,Thank you!
0,I would also like to recommend Foxy Brown
0,Definitely a fan of Pam Grier so I'd take that recommendation as well.
0,Thanks!
0,"HI, I'm here to recommend a movie to you."
0,"hi, i love to watch movies."
0,Seen any good ones lately?
0,"yes, i have watched ford vs ferrari yesterday."
0,Did you like it?
0,"I loved it, one of the best movies I seen it."
0,Got it.
1,"I like to watch usually horror, action and sports movies."
0,"I would recommend you try out Midsommar, if you  haven't seen it already."
0,It's a horror movie.
0,"ok, I would be willing to try that movie."
0,"Another one you may like is Hereditary, which is by the same director."
0,"Both movies are really intense horror films that are really well made, you love them!"
0,hereditary sounds familiar.
0,"but can you recommend Midsommar, i have never seen that movie."
0,"Will do, got it."
0,sounds good to me.
0,"TO give you more detail, it's about a couple who goes to sweden after one of them experiences tragedy and then they tango with this norse hippy cult."
0,that sounds like a kind of movie I would enjoy.
0,"You will, it gets pretty crazy towards the end, a bit trippy, and definitely violent and gruesome."
0,seems like very bloody type of movie.
0,THere's a ton of different stuff that happens.
0,oh yeah it sounds suspenseful and scary.
0,"Hi, how are you?"
0,What genre of movies do you like?
0,Hello!
1,I love romantic comedy  and Drama mainly.
0,Have you seen 50 First Dates?
0,I have and it is exactly the type of movie I like!
0,Great movie!
0,I agree.
0,How about Hitch?
0,"I don't think I have seen it, who is in it?"
0,Kevin James and Will Smith.
0,Will Smith runs a secretive dating business where he helps awkward guys get into a relationship with the girls they like.
0,It is a good one that I have seen several times.
0,"Oh, I love Will Smith!"
0,Is it an older movie?
0,I can't believe I haven't seen it.
0,It is but it is very funny.
0,It's from 2005.
0,"Oh wow, I am such a movie fanatic I am surprised I missed this one."
0,So it has a good sense of humor and not the silly off the wall type of humor?
0,"Yes, I don't like the stuff that is really crazy."
0,It is more humor like the guys who just are not good around girls.
0,Will Smith is of course very suave in this movie.
0,Kevin is one of his clients.
0,Oh that's great!
0,I figured Will Smith would be in a great film.
0,It does sound very good.
0,Would you like to watch the trailer then?
0,I really would love to watch the trailer!
0,Who else is in the film?
0,Any leading ladies?
0,Eva Mendes is one of the main ones.

0,I love her!
0,Thank you so much!

0,Other movies such as Interstellar are great because they get the mind thinking.
0,Have you seen The Martian?
0,Matt Damon is amazing in it!
0,"I have, also an amazing movie!"
0,I would really recommend seeing Frozen 2 if you haven't seen it yet.
0,"There are some really funny scenes in there that throw you back to an 80s/90s boy band music video, some action scenes that just look amazing and I couldn't believe they were animated and really have some heavy themes in it that you wouldn't expect from a Disney Movie."
0,I will certainly go see Frozen 2
0,"Wonderful, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"
0,I hope so too!
0,"I have the trailer ready for you to watch as well, in case you haven't seen it yet."
0,I haven't seen it yet
0,It does a good job of showing some of the themes without giving it away.
0,I'd love to see it
0,The new songs in the movie are really catchy.
0,There is one song that I have heard on the radio that it seems like they are pushing for QUOTATION_MARKLet it Go 2QUOTATION_MARK but there is another song towards the end of the movie I think is way more powerful.
0,That's cool!
0,If you have the option to see the movie in Imax or a higher def screen I recommend it because the animation and visuals are so great.
0,Elsa's magic looks amazing.
0,Unfortunately I do not

0,To you as well.
0,Thanks for the help!
0,"Hello, I'm here to help you find a good movie trailer!"
0,"Hello, thanks for helping me."
0,Sure thing!
0,What genre of movie do you usually watch?
0,I like action and fantasy.
1,I also like good character driven movies.
0,Me too.
0,Movies where someone grows throughout the story are somehow really rewarding to watch.
0,What would you say is your favorite movie that you've seen in the last year?
0,Thats hard to say.
0,The last Avengers movie was really good.
0,"?Ohh, that movie gave me so many different emotions."
0,"Thor had me laughing so hard, but I sobbed at the funeral for Black Widow."
0,"If you liked that movie, have you thought of watching Spiderman: Far From Home?"
0,I have thought about seeing that movie.
0,Is it any good?
0,I really enjoyed it!
0,"The interesting part to me was seeing how Peter's friends from the first movie play such a large role in helping him as Spiderman, considering that I would usually think of Spiderman as a loner by necessity."
0,It made me think about the character in a different way.
0,"That is a new take, I think your right seeing him as a loner."
0,I enjoed the Wolverine movies he is certainly a loner.
0,Very character driven I enjoyed watching his emotions as he delt with taking carte of X-23 in the last film.
0,"I will give Spiderman Far From home a watch, thank you for the sugestion."
0,"You're right, those two characters have a lot of similarities story-wise, even though their personalities are so different."

0,Will do thanks.
0,Have a good day.
0,"Thanks, you as well!"
0,"Oh,is Spider-Man Homecoming the newest ones."
0,Looks like there have been multipule Spiderman movies in the past fifteen years.
0,"Yes, Spider-man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home are the newest versions."
0,"Tom Holland plays Spiderman in these movies and they are a part of the ongoing Marvel cinematic universe, which is why this Spiderman was in the recent Avengers movie that you mentioned!"
0,"Oh, good."
0,Thank makes sense.
0,I can never keep track with all the reboots and things in movies some time.
0,"That makes sense, Spiderman has been redone so many times!"
0,There is even a new animated movie called Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse that subverts the traditional story by skipping most of it.
0,It would be a fun option to pair with the Tom Holland versions for comparison.
0,"Ok, I think I have heard of that too."
0,Spider Gwen is in it.
0,I will check that out too!
0,"Yes, she is!"
0,There are several versions of Spider-man from comics over the years.
0,The whole movie is a beautiful callback to the comics.
0,"Well, I hope you enjoy the Spider-man movies, and hopefully the Tom Holland ones will add to your enjoyment of the Avengers movies, too."
0,I will.
0,Thank you so much for your time.

0,Do you want to watch something similar to that?
1,"Sure, I enjoy movies which tell the story of real life, what do you have in mind?"
0,So you enjoy realistic movies?
0,"If you're looking for a crime/drama like The Irishman, I'd recommend Goodfellas, The Godfather, or El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie."
0,"Or do you mean a non-fiction movie, like a documentary?"
0,Those are all great movies and seen them all several times.
0,I do like documentary's too!
0,I recently saw one about the foods we eat.

0,Do you like documentary's?
0,"Yes, I do!"
0,I like documentaries that focus around mysteries.
0,"Ever since I was a baby, my mom would always be watching true crime documentaries and shows."
0,That's probably why!

0,Totally like them!
0,Its amazing how they find the criminal and how they go about it.
0,I don't like movies which are violent.
0,Not into seeing others in pain nor want to see blood spattered which is why I have not been watching more of the true crime documentary's recently.
0,"How about you, do you like horror and gory movies?"
0,I do.
0,I like the classic horror movies such as Scream and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
0,I like being scared when I watch movies.
0,"However, I just don't find them scary.I think stories are the most important part to a movie, however others I talk to seem to disagree.What about you, what do you value the most when it comes to movies?"
0,I agree with you that the stories are the main ingredient in a movie.
0,What horror movies have good stories.
0,And can we please move this a little faster.
0,I would recommend Get Out.
0,Would you be interested in that?
0,OOOO im totally afraid of that one.
0,It seems like a very serious movie.
0,Is there like an intro type of horror movie for peeps such as myself?
0,How about Split?
0,Its about a man with 23 personalities that kidnaps 3 girls.
0,It was my first horror movie.
0,It's more of a thriller and not so much a gore fest.
0,"Or, the original 80's IT is pretty good as well."
0,"It's quite a long one, but it is a good story."
0,It's also not quite as scary as many of the other horror movies.
0,Would you be interested in either of these?
0,They sound interesting and totally worth the look.
0,What other kinds of movies are you interested in?
1,I'm a 56 yr old man so I can get into some of the older movies.
1,Especially comedies!
1,Have any favorites?
0,"I don't watch comedies as much as horror movies, but my favorite would probably South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut."
0,It's a musical but all the songs are amazing.
0,"I remember when I was a kid I watched it with my mom, and we still quote it every day several years later!"
0,"On top of that, its a great commentary on censorship, commentary that still holds up 20 years later."
0,Would you be interested in that?
0,I love south park and another slam dunk!
0,Its fun to watch someones commentaries on current events with a little comedy in its thread.
0,I did like the Mel Brooks movies in the day.
0,I remember my Father and I laughing till it hurt watching those movies.
0,So is there a movie that you like which is a blend between horror and comedy?
0,I guess the old 80's IT would be an example of that.
0,It was never intended to be a comedy.
0,"But watching it today, you're sure to get a good laugh at Pennywise!"
0,I understand what you mean.
0,I look at the old James Bond movies and laugh on how fake the fight scense look.

0,I've watched Alita and Good Boys recently.
0,Alita was one I really like.
0,Good Boys was ok but not great.
0,"Nice, what is Alita about?"
0,It's about an Android that a guy finds and he rebuilds her.
0,Alot of the movie is about her trying to find out who she is because her memories of the past are gone.
0,"Hey, my friend."
0,What is going on?
0,Hello!
0,Just preparing everything to go back to work tomorrow.
0,How about you?
0,I'm good.
0,Just came back from the theatre.
0,I hear you need some help in selecting a movie to see.
0,I would indeed.
0,I was hoping that you may have some ideas on a good movie to see.
0,What type of film do you usually like?
0,I have several genre's that I like.
0,I enjoy comedies that aren't silly dumb.
1,I also like everyday neighbor type movies.
0,"Well, along the lines of the last one, there is QUOTATION_MARKA beautiful day in the neighborhoodQUOTATION_MARK."
0,Its about Mr. Rogers.
0,Hmmm.
0,Who is in that one?
0,He had a famous childrens show for a while.
0,But he was apparantly a really interesting person in real life.
0,It got great reviews and stars Tom Hanks.
0,"Oh, I usually like Tom Hanks."
0,I remember a little bit about Mr. Rogers.
0,Is it a comedy or more of a biography?
0,It is a biography.
0,But its funny.
0,It sounds like something that I would enjoy.
0,I will accept your recommendation.
0,Cool.
0,But before you go...I just rewatched QUOTATION_MARKThere's something about MaryQUOTATION_MARK.
0,Its a classic comedy...if you want to stay at home.
0,Is that the one with Cameron Diaz?
0,Yes.
0,Matt Damon and Bed Stiller too.
0,A cameo by Brett Favre is also in there.
0,I don't remember Brett Favre.
0,"I think the movie was a bit crude, if I remember."
0,That's not really my thing.
0,Well then by all means stick with a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
0,You love it.
0,Nothing crude about it.
0,Do you have any other ideas for being at home?
0,I do like to have options.
0,You know what you might like.
0,The Truman Show.
0,If you like films about one's neigborhood.
0,Its fascinating.
0,"Oh, I almost watched that one not too long ago."
0,That has Jim Carey?

0,I have two good options now.

0,I like old movies.
0,The last one I watched was the disney movie That Darn Cat and it was great
0,Nice is that the kind of movie you prefer?
0,Yeah and I also like animated movies
0,If I recall that movie was made in the 60's it still holds up today for sure!
0,"Disney made some good live action movies in that era, but I like all kinds of disney stuff"
0,"I remember the Witch Mountain movies, those were pretty good."
1,"I think I only saw the remake of that one, maybe I should watch the original"
0,"The first one was Escape to Witch Mountain, it came out in 1975."
0,I will check that one out then
0,"Return from Witch Mountain actually has Bette Davis in it, would you like to see the trailer?"
0,Oh nice!
0,Yes I will watch it
0,It also has Christopher Lee and Kim Richards.
0,I was incorrect it came out in 1978.
0,My bad!
0,Ah well you were close.
0,I didn't know Christopher Lee was in it.
0,Would you like a quick plot summary?
0,Sure that would be good
0,Basically it is about a brother and sister named Tony and Tia who have telekinetic powers and some unscrupulous people who want to use them for nefarious means.
0,It is about their adventures.
0,I remember their names being different in the remake.
0,Anyway I will definitely check that out
0,"Yes I think the remake took a few liberties from the original, there are actually a couple of them from back then, the first one did pretty well."
0,"The original is probably better, remakes are hardly ever better"
0,Hi there!
0,How are you today?
0,"I am good, how are you doing?"
0,"I'm well thanks, just trying to keep warm."

0,it does have some good one-liners in it.
1,"I am a big fan of mysteries, and trying to figure out what happened throughout the movie."
0,"If you liked that so much, you would also like QUOTATION_MARKThe Good Liar.QUOTATION_MARK"
0,I am a big fan of Helen Mirren.

0,"Action, with humor, and overall great."
0,no.
0,I haven't.
0,Is both the stories connected.
0,Or like second part is continuation of the first part.?
0,They are connected through plotlines and all.

0,LOL!
0,I was curious if you liked the psychological aspect or just straight up horror more?
0,"I like both, but I think I'd like straight up horror more."
0,I was thinking about Haunt and the younger cast and a movie with a bit of twist.
0,That sounds exactly like what I would like.
0,The tough part is finding a good one
0,I think this one might be worth a shot if you are ready?
0,Yep I'm ready
0,Awesome.
0,The movie is QUOTATION_MARKTruth or DareQUOTATION_MARK featuring Lucy Hale of Pretty Little Liars fame.

0,I usually just search the internet for what is new.

0,It was written by the same author as Jumanji and is technically in the same cinematic universe.
